PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP is headed to Texas at 8:30 a.m. to survey the devastation in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. THE PLAN: Trump will arrive in Corpus Christi, receive a briefing, and then head to Austin for a tour of the Emergency Operations Center and a meeting with the state\\'s leaders.\\n\\n-- UNDER THE DOME: D.C. IS BEGINNING TO TURN ITS ATTENTION to the likelihood that it will have to pass a massive emergency spending bill to help rebuild Houston. It will take a while for Texas and the federal government to fully assess its needs. But President Trump yesterday promised \"rapid action from Congress,\" not to mention his vow that the water-logged state will be \"up and running very, very quickly,\" something that emergency managers and Texas officials have pushed back on.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nA FEW PATHS THE LEGISLATING CAN TAKE, per insiders we\\'ve spoken to: Congress can provide an initial down payment by passing the first installment of cash for Texas. That would give lawmakers the opportunity to show they\\'re on top of the situation, while leaving open the possibility that they\\'d have to pass a second -- and larger -- bill. This has upsides and downsides. Upside: it shows immediate action. Downside: Congress would have to act twice. It\\'s hard enough for the institution to do something once.\\n\\nAnother option is to attach a disaster relief bill to a government funding measure. Upside: As long as the bill didn\\'t include funding for the border wall, this would help ease the passage of a bill to fund the government and could stop a September shutdown. Downside: Any time Congress lops one measure onto another something could go wrong.\\n\\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh\\n\\n-- THE REALITY, via Julie Turkewitz in Houston, Richard Perez-Pena in New York and Jack Healy in San Antonio with Dave Montgomery in Austin, Dave Philipps in San Antonio, John Schwartz in New Orleans and Henry Fountain in New York, on A1 of the the NYT: \"Local, state and federal officials conceded that the scale of the crisis was so vast that they were nowhere near being able to measure it, much less fully address it. Across a region that is home to millions of people and includes Houston, the nation\\'s fourth-largest city, no one has a clear idea how many people are missing, how many evacuated, how many hunkered down or were trapped in their waterlogged homes, or how many inundated houses and vehicles are beyond saving.\" http://nyti.ms/2wFm5MD\\n\\n-- L.A. TIMES: \"By Monday evening, the death toll had risen to nine. Officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, reported at least six \\'potentially storm-related\\' fatalities.

With nearly 2 more feet of rain expected on top of the 30-plus inches in some places, authorities worried the worst might be yet to come. The Houston metro area covers about 10,000 square miles, an area slightly bigger than New Jersey.

Heavy rainfall forced reservoir officials to begin releasing water from the dams sooner than previously planned. Col. Lars N.

Jeb Hensarling is digging in his heels on a conservative vision for overhauling the heavily indebted National Flood Insurance Program, which protects millions from the risk of financial calamity. The Texas Republican, who as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee is spearheading efforts to revamp the program before it expires next month, will call on his colleagues to pass his proposal as soon as they return from recess.\\n\\n\"His committee has drafted legislation that would renew the program for five years but also shrink its footprint, make coverage more expensive for policyholders, and ease the pathway for private companies to sell their own flood insurance policies. Opponents say the changes would make coverage less accessible for many homeowners. ... In an interview Monday, as the devastation in Houston began to bring the policy issues to the fore, Hensarling said he was \\'pressing on the accelerator\\' -- not the brake. \\'It\\'s more urgent than ever we get this bill done,\\' he said.\\n\\n\"His characteristic steadfastness puts him at odds with other lawmakers, aides and lobbyists who suggested Congress was more likely to advance a less ambitious flood insurance package, including potentially a short-term extension bill without significant reforms. \\'Hurricane Harvey makes a rapid reauthorization of the NFIP -- in its current form -- more likely,\\' a House Republican leadership aide said. \\'Considering the ongoing disaster in Texas and the fact we are not even halfway through hurricane season, I think there will be immense public and political pressure to get this finished.\\'\" http://politi.co/2wOgJzn\\n\\n-- HENSARLING HAS STRUGGLED for years with changes to the flood insurance program.\\n\\nNORTH KOREA, UNCOWED -- WAPO\\'S ANNA FIFIELD in TOKYO: \"North Korea launched a ballistic missile Tuesday morning that flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the most brazen provocation of Kim Jong Un\\'s five-year-long rule and one that elicited strong condemnation from U.S. allies Japan and South Korea.\\n\\n\"The launch poses a further challenge, in particular, to President Trump, who has made North Korea a favorite rhetorical target. Trump said earlier this month that he would make Kim \\'truly regret\\' harming the United States or its allies. In Japan, the prime minister was visibly agitated by North Korea\\'s actions. \\'A missile launch across Japan is an outrageous act that poses an unprecedented, grave and serious threat, and significantly undermines the peace and security of the region,\\' Shinzo Abe said after an emergency national security council meeting. ...\\n\\n\"In Seoul, President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who has promoted engagement with Pyongyang, ordered an \\'overwhelming show of force\\' in response to the missile launch. South Korea\\'s military aircraft dropped eight bombs on a shooting range on the southern side of the border with North Korea.\" http://wapo.st/2wepm4p\\n\\nTHE BIG PICTURE, NYT A18 -- \"Two Bankers Are Selling Trump\\'s Tax Plan. Is Congress Buying?\" by Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Kate Kelly: \"Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin have spent months behind closed doors with Republican congressional leaders sketching the contours of an elaborate and politically difficult tax overhaul that is President Trump\\'s top priority. ... Already, their ambitions have drifted from the president\\'s original mark: A 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now likely to move to the 20 to 25 percent range, say two people familiar with the officials\\' recent thinking. And a proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the current 39.6 percent cap intact.\\n\\n\"For Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin, quiet competitors since their days as new partners at Goldman Sachs more than two decades ago, the task is a consequential test of whether real-world experience in finance has equipped them to carry out a delicate political negotiation, and whether two Jewish New Yorkers who have been lavish supporters of Democrats can succeed in Mr. Trump\\'s Washington. \\'Goldman has thrived by hiring strong individuals with very different backgrounds and putting them together on a team,\\' Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an email. \\'Gary and Steven are both steeped in that tradition from their years working side by side on the trading floor -- not a bad training ground for the pressure cooker that is Washington.\\' ...\\n\\n\"In a meeting with a group of Senate Democrats this year, according to people who were present, Mr. Cohn jokingly dismissed concerns about the wisdom and cost of repealing the estate tax, remarking, \\'Only morons pay the estate tax.\\' A source close to Mr. Cohn denied that he had used the word, saying he had been referring to \\'rich people with really bad tax planning.\\'\" http://nyti.ms/2iEVQjO\\n\\nTRUMP V. HIS CABINET -- \"Trump rejected China steel offer his officials backed,\" by FT\\'s Demetri Sevastopulo and Shawn Donnan: \"Donald Trump last month rejected a Chinese proposal to cut steel overcapacity despite it being endorsed by some of his top advisers, as he urged them instead to find ways to impose tariffs on imports from China. One week after the July G20 summit in Hamburg -- where Mr. Trump criticised China for flooding the world market with cheap steel -- Beijing proposed cutting steel overcapacity by 150m tonnes by 2022. But Mr. Trump twice rejected the deal, according to several people familiar with the internal debate. ... Wilbur Ross, U.S. commerce secretary, endorsed the deal and brought it to Mr. Trump, but the president rejected the proposal. Mr. Ross, a long-time friend of the president, floated the deal again the following week during the two-day meetings with Chinese vice-premier Wang Yang, but Mr. Trump once again refused to accept it.\" http://on.ft.com/2xu5bhQ\\n\\nDEPT. OF BARK NO BITE -- \"Trump unusually silent after aides challenge him,\" by Josh Dawsey, Ben White and Eliana Johnson: \"President Donald Trump is not happy with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, for publicly criticizing his response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. But it appears there is little he is planning to do about it, according to people who have spoken to him. The unusually direct challenges from a Cabinet secretary and senior administration official seemed to make little more than a surface ripple in the swirling melodrama of the Trump White House, even as the president fumed privately about it. ... Cohn told associates that he hadn\\'t heard a word from the president about his supposed anger -- and that he didn\\'t regret one bit having made his comments.\" http://politi.co/2vFswL1\\n\\n-- BUT, BUT, BUT ... \"Trump Punishes Longtime Aide After Angry Phoenix Speech, Sources Say,\" by Bloomberg\\'s Jen Jacobs and Kevin Cirilli: \"Donald Trump was in a bad mood before he emerged for a confrontational speech in Arizona last week.

In a letter obtained by CNN and written to Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the foreign relations committee, Tillerson said he would end or transfer as many as three dozen special envoy positions. ... Special envoys for Syria, Sudan and South Sudan, and the Arctic will be eliminated.\" http://cnn.it/2wdQ39q\\n\\nBANNON VS. TRUMP -- \"Bannon wages war against Trump-backed candidate in Alabama,\" by Alex Isenstadt: \"Just-departed White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is breaking from President Donald Trump in the closely watched Alabama Senate special election. During a closed-door meeting with powerful conservatives in Washington last week, Bannon declared that he\\'s supporting former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore over Trump-endorsed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, according to two people who were present. ... Appearing before a meeting of the secretive Conservative Action Project, Bannon made it clear that he supported Moore, a favorite among evangelicals, but was careful not to cast it as a break with the president. Rather, he said, it was an act of opposition toward Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is supporting Strange and has made the race a top political priority.\" http://politi.co/2wee68i\\n\\n-- THIS WILL NOT be a fight that McConnell will shy away from.

Many small business owners without flood insurance, in particular, are possibly looking at years of debt and bankruptcies.\\n\\nStill, the mood in Houston\\'s business corridors, like the weather, has lifted, says Bob Eury, president of Central Houston, a non-profit group that plans business development in downtown Houston, which daily sees about 150,000 workers. \"It\\'d appear that most employers in downtown are back up and operating,\" he said Thursday. \"It feels like a normal day today. We\\'re open for business. I want to make that clear.\"\\n\\nThe cycle of destruction-and-recovery will replay in much of Florida in the coming weeks as homes and businesses affected by Hurricane Irma also begin to dig out. While Texas and Florida differ in industries, they are among two of the nation\\'s largest and most economically influential states. And the pace of their recovery could have significant consequences for the broader national economy.\\n\\nEnergy is Houston\\'s primary economic engine, with many oil companies, refineries, pipeline operators and oil rig equipment makers based in the region. But it\\'s also home to some of the world\\'s most renowned hospitals and a thriving aerospace corridor, thanks to a sizable presence of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The gross domestic product of the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan area was $503.3 billion in 2015, the fourth largest of any metro area in the U.S., according to government data, so it\\'s important to the nation that companies and people get back to work as quickly as possible.\\n\\nAfter Harvey struck the region, roughly 27 percent of all leasable space in Houston, including apartments, could be flooded, or about 600 million square feet, estimated CoStar Group, a commercial real estate information firm. About 70 million of it was office buildings, including low-rise structures.\\n\\nDamage from Harvey would likely reach $150 billion to $200 billion, estimated Moody\\'s Analytics.\\n\\nBuffalo Bayou, the slow-moving river that stretches through downtown overflowed after days of rain, flooding the theater district and other parts of downtown.\\n\\nJust two blocks from the Bayou, Alley Theatre, an award-winning indoor theatre in downtown, was still digging out from eight feet of water that ruined its basement stage, Neuhaus Theatre The smaller of Alley\\'s two stages, Neuhaus seats 310 and features a variety of plays and musicals, such as Broadway hit \"Hand to God\" and David Sedaris\\' \"The Santaland Diaries.\"\\n\\nWater -- or more accurately, a black mixture of chemicals, sewage and water -- has been pumped out, having left about $15 million of damage. But also destroyed in the basement are five dressing rooms and most of its 100,000 props that were collected over 70 years, says Dean Gladden, managing director of Alley Theatre.\\n\\n\"I was thinking how the hell am I going to get the water out of here,\" Gladden said recounting his first time seeing the damage in person. He was stuck at home with his block flooded and saw the theater damage at first on a Facebook post by colleagues. \"(When I saw it on Facebook), I said \\'oh, we may have serious problems.\\'... I couldn\\'t get out. My entire street was flooded.\"\\n\\nWhen he finally visited the damaged stage in person the next day, he knew he had to scramble for remediation companies to dry it out, examine air quality and remove mold. But remediation providers were heavily in demand, and he found one through his office building\\'s property manager. \"It was my first call,\" he said.\\n\\nTwo blocks northeast, Houston Ballet was dealing with its own remediation problems. Two of its dance studios were submerged with three inches of water. And three different crews weaved through the facility to remove sheet rock and the thick flooring made especially for jumping dancers, as well as replacing costly water pumps and electrical systems.\\n\\nAbout seven miles south of the ballet company, crews at MD Anderson Anderson Cancer Center, whose main lobby was drenched, deployed dehumidifiers throughout its campus, removed wet drywall and are using infrared cameras to identify unseen wet spots, says Matt Berkheiser, its executive director of environmental health and safety.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some big store operators returned to piles of wet merchandise. A Target store in Humble, Texas, located 19 miles north of downtown, is still closed after it was submerged in six and a half feet of water. Another Target store in South Houston, which had a half foot of water, also remains closed.\\n\\nThe retail giant is in the midst of dumping equipment and damaged merchandise to salvage companies. \"If (merchandise) is not up to 100 percent of our standards, we will not sell (it),\" says John Sheehan, senior group vice president of stores in the Houston area for Target.\\n\\nBut experience with past storms may have mitigated damage for some large companies in the area. After Hurricane Ike ruined the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston with 20 inches of rain in 2008, the academic health center moved key equipment and generators to higher floors, says Jason Botkin, an environmental services manager of Sodexo, which handles facilities management at UTMB. It also deployed a \"ride-out\" team of 68 employees who worked in rotations throughout the storm to serve the 300 patients on site. With little physical damage, the hospital stayed open. \"We were prepared this time,\" he said.\\n\\nCompanies are also contending with displaced workers. HCA, a for-profit hospital chain with 15 hospitals in the Houston area, estimates 10 percent of its nurses have \"significant\" damage at home. And it fired up its company jet and hired private charters to fly in 300 nurses from other parts of the country to make up for the Houston-based nurses who aren\\'t able to make it to work.\\n\\nAbout 18 percent of the employees at Memorial Hermann, one of the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, have lost homes or damaged property. And it\\'s providing hotels and advancing checks for them and shuffling work shifts to continue operations.\\n\\nWith many workers still unable to come to work and expecting a jump in demand for its products, Home Depot -plans to hire more workers in the coming weeks.\\n\\nLarge employers are also tapping their employee-help funds. HCA has given over $1 million in grants -- up to $7,500 per affected employee -- that can be used for home repair, hotel, food and other expenses. Home Depot has distributed about $980,000 in similar funds.\\n\\nFinding new venues for scheduled business commitments and continuing business also sits high on companies\\' to-do lists. Alley Theatre\\'s premier of \"Describe the Night,\" a play about a Russian spy written by playwright Rajiv Joseph, was scheduled for next week at the ruined Neuhaus stage. The play\\'s entire set was also destroyed.\\n\\nAlley\\'s Gladden found a partner in the University of Houston, which agreed to host it at its 185-seat Quintero Theatre. \"It\\'s better than nothing,\" he says. \"In 24 hours, we redesigned the set.\"\\n\\nThe show will go on, as originally scheduled, on Sept. 15.\\n\\nLike this story?

She is one of the heroines of the second half of the 20th century. A symbol of democracy -- and of her country, Burma -- she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. She was under house arrest at the time. Today, she is the leader of Burma, as her father was before her.\\n\\nWhy the great dismay? Because of the persecution of a people called the Rohingya, to which Aung San Suu Kyi seems indifferent, at best. Some people are calling for a dramatic gesture: the stripping of the Nobel prize from the heroine. This is what I\\'d like to touch on here.\\n\\nA Nobel prize cannot be stripped or returned. It is given -- at least in theory -- for work done during the preceding year: the year preceding the particular award. What happens thereafter is irrelevant.\\n\\nIn 1950, an American diplomat working for the United Nations, Ralph Bunche, won the peace prize. He won it for negotiating a general armistice between Israel and its Arab attackers. That armistice was blown to hell. But the Nobel prize stood.\\n\\nThe 1973 Paris Agreement between the United States and North Vietnam was blown to hell, too (by the North Vietnamese). But the Nobel prize given to Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho stood.\\n\\nAnd shall we even speak of the 1994 prize, divided between Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords?\\n\\nAfter Saigon fell, Kissinger tried to return his Nobel. He said he felt \"honor bound\" to do so. But the committee informed him that a Nobel is not returnable, and that they appreciated his \"sincere efforts to get a ceasefire agreement put into force in 1973.\"\\n\\nTo know more about the Nobel Peace Prize, you may like to consult my history, Peace, They Say (published in 2012).\\n\\nYou may have seen a video of Secretary James Mattis talking to some servicemen of ours abroad -- men and women fighting the War on Terror, broadly speaking. Mattis said many interesting things in this short talk. I would like to spotlight one sentence: \"We\\'re gonna keep on fightin\\' until they\\'re sick of us and leave us alone.\"\\n\\nYes. Exactly. Thank you, Mattis.\\n\\nFor a long time, people like me have been talking about getting out of the Iran deal. Reading a report from the Associated Press, I wondered: What if Iran does it first? That report is headed \"Iranian president threatens to revitalize nuclear program,\" here.\\n\\nIn Russia, are you allowed to say that the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939? Well, you can say it, but you may be fined or jailed. Vladimir Luzgin got off with a fine: 200,000 rubles, which is about $3,500. He was probably lucky.\\n\\nTo read about this appalling case, go here. The sky lowers in Russia. Don\\'t let the Kremlin or its apologists fool you.\\n\\nA report in the Times (London) was headed \"Macron gives bosses new powers to hire and fire in a bid to jump-start French economy.\" The first paragraph reads, \"President Macron began a high-stakes gamble to liberalise the French economy yesterday, loosening labour laws to encourage employers to recruit and easing curbs on smaller businesses.\"\\n\\nThe next paragraph reads, \"The fate of the embryonic administration depends largely on his ability to bring about employment reform -- an arena in which his predecessors have failed -- in the face of protests planned by left-wing unions and political opponents this month.\"\\n\\nDo it, Macron. Strength to your hands. France may hate you now, but they\\'ll thank you later.\\n\\nThe above-quoted report used the phrase \"high-stakes gamble.\" I think of \"riverboat gamble.\" That\\'s what Howard Baker called Reagan\\'s economic package in 1981. Baker, a Tennessee Republican, was the majority leader in the Senate.\\n\\nOver the weekend, someone tweeted at me a couple of times, taunting me for not tweeting about Hurricane Irma. He said, \"Climate change got your tongue?\" (or something like that).\\n\\nA thought: I have been reading about devastating hurricanes my whole life (though I haven\\'t experienced one, thank goodness). I was reading about them when people were concerned about cooling -- an overall global winter.\\n\\nI\\'m not a climate scientist, trust me. But I\\'m not going to be bossed around by political zealots either.\\n\\nRecently, I was in London, and I thought of explosives camp -- explosives camp, in Rolla, Mo. (For a piece I wrote about this extraordinary institution, go here.) Why did I think of explosives camp? Because, in a park, I saw the Flying Trapeze School.\\n\\nTo learn about the school, go here. Maybe when I grow up and get my parents\\' permission?\\n\\nIn London, a hotel clerk said, \"Go up to the first floor.\" Such an interesting phrase, to an American ear.\\n\\nI wanted to write a letter -- to hand-write one. Was there any stationery? No, no hotel stationery at all (and this was a rather classy hotel). The clerk said, \"I\\'ve worked here for three years, and no one has ever asked me about stationery!\"\\n\\nTime marches on.\\n\\nI wanted a muffin or a pastry or something like that. Along this London street, there were several caf\\xe9s and similar establishments. There was also a Starbucks. (Well, a Starbucks is a caf\\xe9, granted.) I thought, \"I can\\'t go into Starbucks. For heaven\\'s sake, there\\'s one a block from my home. They\\'re all over. Go to someplace local.\"\\n\\nI went into about three of them -- the baked goods looked bad. I retreated to the Starbucks.\\n\\nIs that bad? (No. Rah capitalism.) (And rah freedom.)\\n\\nOn another street, I was startled to see a statue, a sculpture. A religious one. It was The Return of the Prodigal, by Charlie Mackesy. A moving work of art. Later, I Googled, and found an article about Mackesy, here, and his website, here.\\n\\nWe took a cruise, National Review did. It was a crossing, actually: from Southampton in England to Brooklyn in good ol\\' New York. As you know, the sky is big in Montana. Well, it\\'s also big at sea -- that, I discovered. It is as interesting to watch the sky as it is to watch the sea. Maybe more.\\n\\nOne morning, I was out early: at daybreak. It was Sunday. A song ran through my head: \"Sabbath Morning at Sea,\" from Elgar\\'s Sea Pictures, performed by Janet Baker and Sir John Barbirolli. Want to hear it? Here.\\n\\nA reader gave me a license plate, expired -- it was a vanity tag, from Virginia. It said, \"NATL REV.\" Nice.\\n\\nI met a couple who live in Scottsdale, Ariz. They grew up in South America. They told me a fascinating story, relating to the U.S. today. A woman -- a Mexican -- applied to work in their home. They said, \"Do you have any papers?\" She said she did. Later, she brought in two sheets, both official -- both with stamps and so on. One was from the driver\\'s-license bureau saying that she had failed a test. The other was a deportation notice. The woman couldn\\'t read either one of them.\\n\\nMy friends did not hire her. Anyway, an interesting story, and touching too, I think.\\n\\nOn Friday, I recorded a Need to Know with Mona Charen, here. I\\'d like to tell you a story I told her. In August, I spent a couple of weeks in Salzburg. Some of the days were very hot; other days, less so. In Salzburg, as in much of Europe, air conditioning is very light, if it exists at all. I spent a number of days being very hot. But I got used to the temperatures.\\n\\nThe moment I came home, I went into a store, to pick up some things. I was shocked by the air conditioning -- frozen by it. My body had become unaccustomed to it. The air conditioning almost hurt. But I knew that, in a few days, I would both get used to it and welcome it.\\n\\nFunny about habituation.\\n\\nHeard a couple of workers talking in New York -- along the river (one of them). \"I don\\'t like being down here at night.\" \"Why?\" Pause. Then, \"Too many characters.\"\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nThanks, dear readers, and see you.\\n\\nREAD MORE:\\n\\nDid Bob Dylan Deserve a Nobel Prize?\\n\\nKrugman\\'s Posthumous Nobel\\n\\nHey Obama, How\\'s that Nobel Peace Prize Working Out for You?\\n\\nA word from the National Review Store: To get Digging In: Further Collected Writings of Jay Nordlinger, go here.', u'title': u'A woman and her peace prize, &c., by Jay Nordlinger, National Review', u'url': u'http://www.nationalreview.com/article/451228/aung-san-suu-kyi-and-her-peace-prize-c-jay-nordlingers-impromptus-september-11-2017', u'uri': u'724703584', u'eventUri': None, u'dateTime': u'2017-09-10T22:00:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-10', u'source': {u'title': u'nationalreview.com', u'id': u'3914', u'uri': u'nationalreview.com'}, u'time': u'22:00:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 4, u'id': u'14565958', u'sim': 0}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'Marigot - Hurricane Irma sowed a trail of deadly devastation through the Caribbean on Wednesday, reducing to rubble the tropical islands of Barbuda and St Martin and claiming at least seven lives.\\n\\nOne of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, the dangerous Category Five hurricane was churning off the north coast of Puerto Rico on Wednesday night, on a potential collision course with south Florida where at-risk areas were evacuated.\\n\\nThe French part of St Martin - a pristine resort known for its vibrant nightlife - suffered the storm\\'s full fury: at least six people died and 95% of dwellings were decimated, officials said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an enormous catastrophe.

This rainfall occurred in just over a day\\'s time.\\n\\n-- Hurricane Dennis in August 1981, which was a tropical storm at the time of landfall, dropped 25.56 inches of rain at Homestead over about two days. Dennis made landfall in Monroe County on Aug. 17 and then moved north-northeastward. Rainfall totaled 5 to 10 inches over most of South Florida, with 20-25 inches totals in southern Miami-Dade County.\\n\\n-- Tropical Storm Hermine occurred in September 1998, dropping 14.14 inches at Fort Lauderdale beach over the course of a couple of days. Much of coastal southeast Florida received more than 10 inches of rain. Hermine was not even a named storm when it affected South Florida. It later made landfall as a tropical storm in Louisiana.\\n\\n-- Hurricane Irene in October 1999 dropped 17.45 inches of rain in Boynton Beach and a widespread 10 to 15 inches of rain across southeast Florida.

And just about all the surrounding vegetation has vanished, as if the formerly lush hills above had been torched.\\n\\nWhen Hurricane Irma screamed through this luxe retreat on St. John, where more than half the villas were destroyed by flooding and fierce winds, Troy Neil and his pregnant wife watched from one of those villas as their catamarans and the other boats they charter were battered and their livelihood wrecked.\\n\\n\"It looked like a nuclear bomb went off here,\" said Neil, owner of Cruz Bay Watersports, who had to flee his Westin villa with his wife and 2-year-old son when the roof blew off.\\n\\nIrma tore through resorts in St. John and St. Thomas, rendering many of the popular escapes uninhabitable to travelers and flatlining the region\\'s economic pulse. In hard-hit St. Thomas, where downed power lines and trees littered nearly every road, resorts such as the lush Sugar Bay Resort and Spa and Frenchman\\'s Reef & Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort are still determining whether structures are safe and when repairs can begin.\\n\\nMany Caribbean islands escaped the hurricane unscathed or barely touched, but those that stood directly in its path, such as St. Bart\\'s, Anguilla, St. Martin, Turks and Caicos, and the US Virgin Islands, face a long road to rebuilding services and drawing back essential tourism dollars.\\n\\nAlthough most of their boats have been damaged or destroyed, the Neils vowed to remain on St. John and rebuild their business, which ferried about 200 tourists a day to snorkel on nearby reefs or cruise to the other islands. Like millions of others throughout the Caribbean, they rely on tourism for their livelihood.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pretty deep cut that we\\'re sewing up the best we can,\" said Neil\\'s wife, Dana, who wears a diamond-encrusted pendant of St. John around her neck. \"We\\'re not giving up.\"\\n\\nFor those who remain on this and other hurricane-ravaged islands in the region, where at least 38 people died when Irma swept from Barbuda to the Florida Keys this month, there\\'s little other choice than to rebuild.\\n\\nLast year, the Caribbean\\'s growing tourism industry accounted for about 15 percent of the region\\'s gross domestic product, or $56.4 billion, and supported 2.3 million jobs, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council, an industry group in London.\\n\\nIn the US Virgin Islands, tourism employs about half of the 100,000 people who live there, which includes St. Thomas and St. Croix, according to Euromonitor International, a market research company. Those numbers have increased significantly over the past five years after a major oil refinery, Hovensa, on St. Croix, closed in 2012.\\n\\nOverall, tourism last year contributed nearly $600 million to the islands\\' economy, bolstered by nearly 18 million cruise ship passengers who visited St. Thomas and St. John, according to the Virgin Islands Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\nThe recovery for hotels and other tourism businesses could take a few months for some -- the general manager of the Westin on St. John said he hoped to be \"fully operational\" within six months -- but it could take years for others.\\n\\nOn St. Thomas, the damage at Bluebeard\\'s Castle Resort was so severe that officials estimate 80 percent of the 186 rooms were beyond repair and would have to be totally rebuilt.\\n\\n\"I\\'d say it will take at least a year and a half or two years before we\\'re back in business,\" said Joe DeSantis, a manager at Bluebeard\\'s, as his workers sought to clear debris and patch up damaged roofs. \"This place is a real mess.\"\\n\\nAnalysts who monitor the tourist industry compared the fallout from Irma to when Hurricane Ivan, also a Category 5 storm, hit the Cayman Islands and Grenada with 155-mile-per-hour winds in 2004.\\n\\nIt took the wealthy Caymans, an autonomous British territory, more than seven years for tourism levels to return to pre-Ivan levels, while the less-developed Grenada took a decade, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.\\n\\nThose who promote tourism in the Caribbean are coping with more than the billions of dollars of damage and lost tourism revenue from Irma; they\\'re also worried about the long-term perception among travelers that the islands are unsafe. There were reports of looting on St. John and other islands, one factor that led hundreds of residents to flee.\\n\\nTravel agents, hotels, and tour operators have already received a flood of cancellations.\\n\\nMichelle Fage, who helps organize weddings in the Virgin Islands, has had to tell 18 couples that their plans for the rest of this year and next year had to be canceled.\\n\\n\"It has been heartbreaking to do this,\" said Fage, a St. John resident whose company is called Paradise Planning. \"From boat captains to hotel workers, so many people lost their jobs in the matter of hours.\"\\n\\nCaribbean tourism is also taking a hit from the damage Irma and Harvey wrought in Florida and Texas. More than 14 million Americans visit the Caribbean each year, many from those areas.\\n\\n\"People in Florida and Texas whose homes have been wiped out are not going to be planning a dream vacation to the Caribbean this year,\" said Hugh Riley, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, which promotes tourism in the region. \"Those are important markets for us.\"\\n\\nOn St. John, even for those businesses that survived the storm, the aftermath promises to deliver a blow.\\n\\nAt the Cruz Bay Boutique Hotel, where there was minimal water damage and generators kept air conditioners running in some of the 11 rooms, David Guidi, the owner, said cancellations are \"snowballing.\"\\n\\n\"This is absolutely the worst disaster we\\'ve experienced,\" said Guidi, who has run the hotel for seven years. \"The real storm for us is the cancellations and the negative press.\"\\n\\nTheir cancellations have already stretched into February. \"It\\'s like a run on the bank,\" he said.\\n\\nFor Robert Gonzales, a lawyer from Nashville who moved to St. John in 2012 to rent apartments and enjoy the good life, four of his six units were destroyed by Irma.\\n\\nHe and his wife, with their 11-month-old son, now plan to move back to Tennessee, where he intends to resume working in law to make ends meet.\\n\\nStill, he remained optimistic about the island\\'s prospects. \"St. John is an extraordinarily beautiful place,\" he said. \"When it gets cold up north, I think people will look to come back.\"\\n\\nOn Thursday morning, employees at the Estate Lindholm were discarding soggy mattresses and digging through the rubble that was recently the hotel\\'s main office and restaurant.\\n\\nOther workers were wielding machetes to salvage what was left of the once-manicured garden.\\n\\n\"This is a painful process, but I\\'m totally bullish on the future,\" said Brion Morrisette, the owner. \"There\\'s no other option.\"\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t clear whether every business would survive. Multiple residents said they had heard that the venerable Caneel Bay Resort may not reopen. Guards at the entrance turned a reporter away on a recent visit, and a spokesman declined to answer questions about the 61-year-old hotel\\'s future.\\n\\n\"At this time the resort team is focusing on the welfare and the well-being of the employees and continuing to evaluate damage on property,\" said Jamie Goldstein, a spokesman for the resort, in a statement. \"We have determined that Caneel Bay Resort will remain closed through the end of 2017 and, once we have further information, we will share news on 2018 as well.\"\\n\\nAt the Westin, where security guards protected the entrance, the staff was still serving hot meals -- for free to neighbors and anyone else who stopped by -- and looking ahead.\\n\\nSamuel Hugli, the general manager, said he hoped to reopen the restaurant in two weeks and by March welcome back the roughly 1,000 guests who typically stay there during the high season.\\n\\nFirst, he said, they would have to dig out the pool, which remains buried under sand. Other repairs, he estimated, would cost the resort as much as $90 million.', u'title': u\"Enormous hurdles ahead for Virgin Islands' tourism industry - The Boston Globe\", u'url': u'https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2017/09/16/enormous-hurdles-ahead-for-virgin-islands-tourism-industry/Uh6dlhddeqahVAaFOY2xiP/story.html', u'uri': u'726928975', u'eventUri': u'eng-3432189', u'dateTime': u'2017-09-16T21:59:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-16', u'source': {u'title': u'The Boston Globe', u'id': u'512', u'uri': u'bostonglobe.com'}, u'time': u'21:59:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 6, u'id': u'15136591', u'sim': 0.4745098054409027}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'If Jay-Z had his way back in 1996, this list would be too brief to warrant compiling. The skinny kid from Brooklyn\\'s Marcy Projects intended to drop just one album -- a musical I was here statement -- before partnering with a major label and falling back into a comfy executive role, becoming a vessel to launch hopeful Roc-A-Fella acts like Memphis Bleek and Christi\\xf3n into orbit.\\n\\nBut the industry had different plans. Def Jam, impressed with Roc-A-Fella\\'s early independent success, agreed to sign a joint venture with the young imprint on one condition: They needed seven albums from Jay. And now, two decades (and two dozen solo LPs) later, Jay-Z has become one of music\\'s all-time most important voices. His catalogue contains some of the most potent imagery and lucid storytelling about poverty and the desperation that it breeds, all while dominating mainstream pop music, in a delicate tightrope act that almost no one else has ever been able to manage for the span of time that Jay has. His merging of thinking-man street raps with commercial hits paved the way for artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole to do the same today.\\n\\nJay-Z\\'s adolescence coincided with the Reagan \\'80s. He\\'d spend his time banging on the kitchen table at his 534 Flushing Avenue apartment, rhyming to the percussion he created. But as an adolescent, he put his hobby on the backburner and crack sales on the front. But he continued to develop his craft, taking stock of hip-hop\\'s evolving aesthetics and mastering hyperspeed raps in the vein of East Coast rap duo Das EFX. Jay moved in and out of rapper circles in the late \\'80s and early \\'90s, popping up on songs with his mentor, Jaz-O, and Big Daddy Kane. He\\'d adopt a slower, more conversational pace for his 1996 masterpiece debut LP, Reasonable Doubt, a project that was self-released after his undeniable talent was denied by every major label he approached.\\n\\nHe followed that with the inconsistent, overly polished In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, which took more than a few cues from the flashy rap aesthetic that Puff Daddy had been proliferating through his Bad Boy label. The sound fit Jay just as well as one of Biggie\\'s oversized Coogi sweaters might have -- there are hints of genius, but he was clearly still finding his voice and place in the art form.\\n\\nFrom 1998 through 2003, Jay was unstoppable. He released at least one project annually, while nurturing promising new talent like Philadelphia-based rappers Freeway and Beanie Sigel. With the help of brilliant music minds like Kanye West, Just Blaze, and the Neptunes, Jay dictated the course of hip-hop and emerged as a keen songwriter who knew exactly how to maximize the strengths of his collaborators. He released his career-defining LP The Blueprint in 2001 and released the excellent retirement fake-out The Black Album just two years later.\\n\\nBut Jay never really committed to his retirement. From 2004 on, he seemed hell-bent on proving that he still had what it took to keep the No. 1 spot. Every release from this period of his career had a strategic selling point, whether it was a marquee collaborator like R. Kelly, Kanye West, or Linkin Park, or a calculated buy-in -- Kingdom Come and Budweiser, American Gangster and the film American Gangster, Magna Carta ... Holy Grail and Samsung. These albums range from lyrically and musically progressive, to painfully awkward and unfocused.\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s too early to determine, but Jay-Z\\'s latest album, the confessional 4:44, seems to be the start of a new phase in the rapper\\'s career. It\\'s a human album that builds on familiar topics like black nationalism, infidelity, and money phones, but here, he handles these topics with more maturity and sophistication than ever before.\\n\\nThe expensive, No I.D.-chopped samples -- Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sister Nancy, the Fugees -- are significant in their own right, creating a mature and well-worn ambiance unlike anything else streaming on Spotify\\'s RapCaviar playlist. 4:44 is the late-career big-budget home run that Hov needed.\\n\\nSo what\\'s next for Jay-Z? It\\'s never been harder to predict where he\\'s headed musically -- which is why it\\'s the perfect time to look back on his entire body of work. Below, you\\'ll find a comprehensive listing of Jay-Z\\'s songs with some parameters for manageability: no freestyles over someone else\\'s beats (sorry \"Young, Gifted and Black\"), no song in which Jay-Z is not the lead artist (unless it appears on a DJ compilation). No leaked tracks, no mash-ups, and no remixes -- a tricky restriction given Jay\\'s penchant for sequels.\\n\\nBefore we get into it, props are due to Sean Fennessey -- and by extension, DJ Clark Kent -- whose 2008 Jay-Z songography for Vibe magazine was a crucial cornerstone of this list\\'s creation.\\n\\nHere\\'s Jay-Z\\'s full canon (so far), from most regrettable -- two albums with R. Kelly! -- to most remarkable.\\n\\n274. \"Anything,\" Kingdom Come (2006): Jay-Z\\'s first ever collaboration with Usher is an ode to amateur night at the strip club.\\n\\n273. \"Tru Life Intro,\" Tru York (2007): Hov spends two minutes firing spoken subliminal shots at Cam\\'ron and Jim Jones, and introducing the world to rapper Tru Life. The final minute features some struggle patois and one of Jay\\'s most throwaway of throwaway freestyles.\\n\\n272. \"Bitches & Sisters,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): At best, this N.W.A-sampling cut is a misguided attempt at celebrating stand-up women and shaming shady ones. At worst, it\\'s an indefensible cocktail of misogyny and respectability politics that Jay for some reason made sure to retain as a bonus cut on the abridged rerelease Blueprint 2.1.\\n\\n271. \"Nickels and Dimes,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Hov expresses his side in a squabble over social responsibility with civil-rights icon Harry Belafonte that should\\'ve never happened. We could\\'ve done without this song, too.\\n\\n270. \"I Know What Girls Like,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Ah, yes, the phase when Jay-Z was blinded by Puff Daddy\\'s shiny suits. Who decided it was a good idea to crate dig in the Waitresses\\' catalogue?\\n\\n269. \"La Familia,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Keep the phrase \"facts only\" and Lil Wayne jab, delete the rest.\\n\\n268. \"Pretty Girls,\" Unfinished Business (2004): In 2002, Jay-Z and R. Kelly joined forces for The Best of Both Worlds, an unprecedented duet album uniting two hip-hop and R&B giants. The project was doomed, though, once a video that allegedly shows the Chicago singer having sex with (and urinating on) an underage girl began making the rounds -- Jay wisely fell back from the project like Homer Simpson sinking into a bush. The controversy seemed to be simmering down two years later (despite 14 then-pending child-pornography charges against Kelly in Chicago) and the two stars gave it another go. Still, after \"that VHS tape,\" the title and subject matter of this generic song should\\'ve raised a red flag.\\n\\n267. \"As One,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): A rip-off of Earth, Wind & Fire\\'s \"Fantasy\" that serves as a roll call for Roc-A-Fella\\'s newly bolstered roster. Maurice White deserved better.\\n\\n266. \"Shorty,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): R. Kelly sings about sexing \"pretty girls\" from coast to coast -- and specifically cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. The following year, Kelly was actually arrested in Miami after police found 12 images of a nude, underage girl in his Florida home. Those child-pornography charges were later dropped after a technicality deemed the photos inadmissible in court. But yeah, this song is okay, I guess.\\n\\n265. \"2 Many Hoes,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Jay\\'s second Blueprint album is weighed down by filler songs like this male groupie shooing.\\n\\n264. \"Reminder,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): Hov re-reintroduces himself by running down his r\\xe9sum\\xe9 in a meticulous manner and demanding that fans, peers, and bloggers put some respek on his name. Singer K. Briscoe\\'s hook is robotic and irksome.\\n\\n263. \"Hollywood,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A stripped-down, Beyonc\\xe9-led version of this track appears on the deluxe version of her album B\\'Day, which dropped months earlier. \"Hollywood\" fits much better there -- too much woe-is-me fame bemoaning from Jay on an already out-of-touch Kingdom Come.\\n\\n262. \"Jockin\\' Jay-Z (Dopeboy Fresh),\" B-side (2008): Even Jay\\'s most loyal fans act as if this holdover from The Blueprint 3 never happened. Kanye\\'s hyperventilating synths and Run-DMC sample are ill-fitting for Hov. If nothing else, the track delivers a needed response after Noel Gallagher disparaged his 2008 Glastonbury Festival headlining slot: \"That bloke from Oasis said I couldn\\'t play guitar / Somebody shoulda told him I\\'m a fucking rock star.\"\\n\\n261. \"Venus vs. Mars,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): Jay may have been reading too many self-help books.\\n\\n260. \"Things That U Do,\" Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Long before Future and Drake made the flute hip-hop\\'s hottest instrument of 2017, Swizz Beatz programmed this basic woodwind melody for a contrived attempt at a hit record.\\n\\n259. \"She\\'s Coming Home With Me,\" Unfinished Business (2004): An unnecessary revisiting of the stronger \"Somebody\\'s Girl\" from two years earlier. Hey, did you know that R. Kelly has been running what\\'s been described as an abusive and manipulative sex cult at his homes in Georgia and Illinois, according to an extensively reported BuzzFeed expos\\xe9?\\n\\n258. \"S. Carter,\" Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): From the music to the lyrics, this song feels limp. Aside from being a vehicle to showcase Amil, who already has two other appearances on this album, it really has no reason to exist.\\n\\n257. \"Off That,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): In the early 2000s, Jay-Z popularized and then killed the trend of wearing retro Mitchell & Ness jerseys in favor of another fashion fad: button-up shirts. He must\\'ve become a bit high on his own influence. It\\'s the only way to explain this silly Drake-sponsored attempt to buck some more trends -- from Timberland boots to money showers at the strip club.\\n\\n256. \"Young Forever,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009):\\n\\nIn this song\\'s defense, it goes down much smoother when performed live, with Beyonc\\xe9 singing the hook in place of Mr. Hudson. Still, Jay should stay away from \\'80s pop samples. And Mr. Hudson.\\n\\n255. \"Break Up (That\\'s All We Do),\" Unfinished Business (2004): Another recycled concept from The Best of Both Worlds that adds nothing new to its predecessor (\"Break Up to Make Up\"). Even the titles are nearly identical, ugh.\\n\\n254. \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour),\" Hope for Haiti Now (2010): A charity track in support of survivors of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Jay-Z syncs up with Rihanna and U2\\'s Bono and the Edge for a sincere dedication. Musically, the sum is not greater than its parts.\\n\\n253. \"Versus,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Jay nods to A Tribe Called Quest on this quickie of an interlude that has promise, but is too brief to ever really establish itself.\\n\\n252. \"The Return,\" Unfinished Business (2004): Jay has better Slick Rick impressions in his catalogue.\\n\\n251. \"H.O.V.A.,\" The Desert Storm Mixtape: DJ Envy Blok Party Vol. 1 (2003): Yet another name-based anthem that uses a hollering vocal sample to big-up Jay, who in return drops a freestyle that sounds like he\\'s just fooling around.\\n\\n250. \"Dig a Hole,\" Kingdom Come (2006): This retort to Cam\\'ron\\'s caustic \"You Gotta Love It\" puffs out its chest and builds the anticipation for a dismantling, but in the end it\\'s just a slap on the wrist.\\n\\n249. \"Lookin\\' at My S Dots\" (2003): To think, this glorified Reebok ad would\\'ve graced The Black Album in place of the legend-making \"Public Service Announcement (Interlude)\" if not for an eleventh-hour spurt of inspiration from Just Blaze. \"Lookin\\' at My S Dots\" is fine as a one-minute short, but it would\\'ve dated the LP with of-the-moment references to NBA ballplayers Kenyon Martin and Shawn Marion.\\n\\n248. \"Blue\\'s Freestyle/We Family,\" 4:44 (2017): Come for Blue Ivy\\'s mumble raps (that flow, though!); stay for Jay deriding Trump and pledging the importance of kin while a sample of Colombian singer Tot\\xf3 la Momposina\\'s voice plays in the background. This bonus track is a decent addition to 4:44, but sits among the project\\'s weaker material.\\n\\n247. \"Big Chips,\" Unfinished Business (2004): After canceling their first collaborative album, Jay and Kelly never came close to recapturing their magic from classics like \"Fiesta (Remix),\" although this horn-laden single tries its best.\\n\\n246. \"Pussy,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): Songs like this make you wonder what was discussed during this album\\'s in-studio brainstorming sessions. After Kellz and Jay tell cautionary tales about man\\'s carnal weakness, Devin the Dude shares an anecdote about losing his virginity at age 7.\\n\\n245. \"You\\'re Welcome\" (2008): \"This is much more than marketed music,\" Jay-Z raps on a languid Mary J. Blige-featuring track recorded to boost anticipation for their co-headlining Heart of the City tour that year. You might believe him, if a usually high-energy Swizz didn\\'t sound so dry on this overall meh loosie.\\n\\n244. \"We Got Em Goin,\" Unfinished Business (2004): Memphis Bleek and Jay add some flair to an insipid album cut with a bridge in which they complete each other\\'s rhymes for four bars over a beat switch-up.\\n\\n243. \"Pop 4 Roc,\" Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): A passable Roc-A-Fella posse cut that feels more like a team-building exercise. Check out Amil\\'s \"4 Da Fam,\" released one year later for the real deal.\\n\\n242. \"Shake Ya Body,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): Trackmasters\\' synth chirps and Lil Kim\\'s repetitive chorus make this a guilty-pleasure earworm.\\n\\n241. \"For My Thugs,\" The Tunnel (1999): A lukewarm Roc-A-Fella family affair that unites Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Jay-Z, and Amil. As it\\'s title suggests, it\\'s a gritty episode, best depicted by this callous threat from Hov: \"Running the streets, lawless, blastin\\' police / Sticking Furby\\'s out the window, snatchin\\' your niece.\"\\n\\n240. \"Roc Army,\" Paid in Full Soundtrack (2002): A sparse Roc cross-pollination designed to unite Cam\\'ron with State Property, under Jigga\\'s supervision. The verses are choppy and the song is mostly bloated with soundbites from older material.\\n\\n239. \"The City Is Mine,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): The eulogy to late friend Biggie Smalls feels heartfelt, but Jay\\'s posturing as rap\\'s next in line here is unconvincing.\\n\\n238. \"Trouble,\" Kingdom Come (2006): There\\'s some pretty harsh subliminal sniping at unnamed targets in the closing verse, but this song is probably best remembered as a hint of the impending release of \"4:44,\" 11 years early. \"If my hand\\'s in the cookie jar, know one thing / I\\'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring,\" he rhymes over Dr. Dre\\'s staticky instrumental.\\n\\n237. \"(Always Be My) Sunshine,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Foxy Brown and Jay-Z\\'s glitzy follow-up to \"Ain\\'t No Nigga\" misses its mark, badly. The song reeks of trendy pandering; the polychromatic music video, with its fish-eye camerawork, is a Top 10 corniest Hov moment.\\n\\n236. \"Feelin\\' You in Stereo,\" Unfinished Business (2004): Well, this sure is meta. R. Kelly sings about trying to conjure the sexiest lyrics and music possible for this actual song, and Jay enables him by dropping eight bars of metaphors about waistlines and bass lines. It\\'s not terrible, though, just too goofy for anyone\\'s sex playlist.\\n\\n235. \"Lift Off,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Kanye West and Jay-Z held a listening session for Watch the Throne at the American Museum of Natural History\\'s Hayden Planetarium. As the album played, attendees watched an outer-space light show, with shooting stars zipping across an overhead screen. The setting particularly amplified this galactic Beyonc\\xe9-guested track, despite Kanye\\'s verse sounding like placeholder vocals and Hov not saying much of anything, either.\\n\\n234. \"Mo\\' Money,\" Unfinished Business (2004): Another phoned-in update of a superior Best of Both Worlds track (\"Get This Money\") and a spectacular example of why sometimes more is less.\\n\\n233. \"What They Gonna Do\" / \"What They Gonna Do Part II,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Shawn Carter flirts with dancehall -- at the time a scalding-hot mainstream fascination -- but stops short of fully committing musically. The alternate version retains his verses, but backpedals by swapping out Sean Paul\\'s vocals and adding a Timbaland beat that possesses not even a sprinkle of jerk seasoning.\\n\\n232. \"Stop,\" Unfinished Business (2004): Kellz reignites an odd R&B beef with Sisqo, while Foxy and Jay drop solid verses without a single mention of Bonnie or Clyde.\\n\\n231. \"I Made It,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A saccharine dedication to Jay-Z\\'s mother that\\'ll make you say \"aww\" but probably will never listen to again.\\n\\n230. \"All Around the World,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): While there\\'s nothing especially wrong with this atlas-scanning cut, it\\'s the type of bland fodder that prevented The Blueprint\\xb2 from living up to its predecessor.\\n\\n229. \"Fuck All Nite,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): A Pharrell-guested track that\\'s good for a nice, mindless two-step and not much else.\\n\\n228. \"Holy Grail,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013):\\n\\nJustin Timberlake\\'s melodramatic singing about the pitfalls of fame borders on comical.\\n\\n227. \"Nigga Please,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): A checklist of riches, accolades, and overall bragging rights over a forgettable beat from Pharrell and Chad Hugo.\\n\\n226. \"Tom Ford,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): \"I don\\'t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford\" is one of rap\\'s great non sequiturs.\\n\\n225. \"20 Bag Shorty,\" The Projects Presents: Balhers Forever (2000): Jay\\'s braggadocio is impeccable on this deep cut that\\'s likely only recognizable to stans.\\n\\n224. \"Don\\'t Let Me Die,\" Unfinished Business (2004): An impassioned soul-baring prayer from Robert Kelly -- who\\'s obviously been battling demons for some time now -- on an otherwise uninspired project.\\n\\n223. \"BBC,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Justin Timberlake, Pharrell, Nas, Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, and Jay-Z put their heads together and came up with this tepid ode to \\'80s drug-dealer paraphernalia.\\n\\n222. \"They Don\\'t Love You No More,\" I Changed a Lot (2015):\\n\\nSports fans gave Jay (perhaps unwarranted) shit for the line, \"Boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team\" -- a perceived Drake diss -- pointing out that lacrosse is indeed a full-contact sport. Still, Hov fit right in over ringing gongs on his first proper DJ Khaled collaboration alongside Rick Ross, French Montana, and Meek Mill.\\n\\n221. \"Girl\\'s Best Friend,\" Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Jay personifies diamonds to fit the plot of the cop comedy Blue Streak (this song also appears on the soundtrack). But this cut seems more like cubic zirconia compared to harder Swizz-produced singles of the era (i.e., \"Money, Cash, Hoes\").\\n\\n220. \"Wishing on a Star,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): The cover of Rose Royce\\'s song of the same name sounds flat, but this is a warm recollection of childhood\\'s innocent days. There\\'s no talk of Jay\\'s hustler past here -- a rarity -- but instead he recalls cutting school, playing run, catch and kiss, and imitating his favorite rappers in the mirror, armed with a brush as a microphone.\\n\\n219. \"Paper Chase,\" Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998): On wax, Foxy Brown makes for a convincing Bonnie to Jay-Z\\'s Clyde. Still, it\\'s awkward to listen back on their old collabos now that she\\'s been replaced by his real-life spouse, who also happens to be the world\\'s most famous pop star.\\n\\n218. \"Justify My Thug,\" The Black Album (2003): This revision of Madonna\\'s \"Justify My Love\" fittingly gets flack as The Black Album\\'s weak link. It is a curious choice for a remake, but DJ Quik\\'s synthesizer rounds out the album with a catchy Cali bounce.\\n\\n217. \"Beach Is Better,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): At under a one-minute runtime, this is a missed opportunity for a playful, fly-on-the-wall look inside the Carter household. Still, \"Girl, why you never ready?\" is a delicious \"They\\'re just like us!\" moment.\\n\\n216. \"Hate,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): Some of the inflections are weird, but Kanye wins this kooky pre-Watch the Throne track with some amusing laser-gun and car-engine onomatopoeias.\\n\\n215. \"Hello Brooklyn 2.0,\" American Gangster (2007): Lil Wayne and his idol address the borough of Brooklyn as a woman, with help from a significant Beastie Boys sample. Not quite the best-rapper-alive lyrical showdown that rap heads craved in \\'07 (that\\'d come via Weezy\\'s \"Mr. Carter\" the following year) but this still has a nice bounce to it.\\n\\n214. \"A Dream,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): The allure of this dialogue from beyond with the Notorious B.I.G. wears off after the first listen, but props to Jay for finding new ways to keep Biggie\\'s legacy alive.\\n\\n213. \"Get Your Mind Right Mami,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Singer Rell was an underused member of the Roc; but here he helps Snoop, Bleek, and Jay\\'s pimp talk go down easier.\\n\\n212. \"F.U.T.W.,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Jay-Z sure knows how to blow his own horn. Here he presents his unlikely success as a disruptive force, likening himself to Muhammad Ali and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. How could you not root for this guy?\\n\\n211. \"Real Niggaz,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): There\\'s a historical significance here: Jay invites Too $hort along as his first rap collaborator from beyond the Big Apple, following a model Biggie established on Life After Death (which also features the Bay Area rapper, among other regional stars). Still, this beat is plodding, and the track slows the momentum of Vol. 1\\'s back half.\\n\\n210. \"Hova Song (Intro)\" / \"Hova Song (Interlude)\" / \"Hova Song (Outro),\" Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Jay accomplishes a lot in the space of three brief free-form rhymes over an eerie K-Rob instrumental: He snaps at 50 Cent, compares himself to a pre-Russiagate Donald Trump, and maintains his stance as a rap deity, asking, \"Do you believe? It\\'s Hova the God.\"\\n\\n209. \"I Did It My Way,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Frank Sinatra is one of Hov\\'s favorite figures to emulate; he likens himself to the legendary singer with Mafia ties by sampling his 1969 classic \"My Way\" -- albeit the less-popular Paul Anka version (it was cheaper to clear than Sinatra\\'s).\\n\\n208. \"A Star Is Born,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): This song finds Jay chronicling the rise and runs of his peers and neophytes. It approaches gimmicky ground when he introduces his own rap prospect, but J. Cole seizes his moment with the song\\'s hottest internal rhyme: \"The flow\\'s cold as the shoulders / Of gold-digging hoes / When a broke nigga approaches.\"\\n\\n207. \"The Game Is Mine,\" Creative Control (2010): Green Lantern recorded and jumbled sounds from a live tennis match for what was intended to be a Reebok ad on wax. Instead it became a stand-alone short that finds Hov announcing his partial ownership of the Brooklyn Nets.\\n\\n206. \"Get This Money,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2004): This sounds like every song about life on the other side of the club\\'s VIP rope.\\n\\n205. \"History,\" More Than a Game Soundtrack (2008): Somewhere within this muddled and vague extended metaphor about success, defeat, victory, death, and history, Jay is trying to congratulate Barack Obama for becoming America\\'s first black president, I think.\\n\\n204. \"Moonlight,\" 4:44 (2017):\\n\\nThere are some important messages about the struggle of being a black creative on here, mixed with ideas on acceptable Instagram etiquette, according to Shawn Corey Carter. Unfortunately, the Fugees-sampling beat is the Ambien-induced version of DJ Khaled\\'s \"Nas Album Done,\" and Jay raps like he\\'s reading Blue Ivy a bedtime story.\\n\\n203. \"It Ain\\'t Personal,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): Jay and R. Kelly express the confusion that comes with fake friends, both sounding conflicted. This simile from Hov still evokes a chuckle, though: \"And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov changed / Nope, Hov\\'s still here like Rogaine.\"\\n\\n202. \"Guns and Roses,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Rap-rock hybrids can be tricky to pull off, but Lenny Kravitz blends in nicely on this one (their 2004 collabo \"Storm\" is even funkier). Unfortunately, Hov tries to kick knowledge but instead offers questionable optimism: \"Even a garbage can gets a steak,\" he raps, a failed offer of encouragement.\\n\\n201. \"Don\\'t U Know,\" Paid in Full Soundtrack (2002): This originated as a Nas diss before it hit the public -- according to Just Blaze, Jay adapted it into a more general single for the streets. The final draft retained some subliminal shots, but ultimately sounds like Hov is shadowboxing with himself. Jay\\'s punch lines and puns show he\\'s as light on his feet as ever.\\n\\n200. \"Do U Wanna Ride,\" Kingdom Come (2006): An open letter -- or, as it\\'s depicted here, a collect call -- to Jay-Z\\'s then-incarcerated friend Emory Jones, looking back on their poor upbringings and painting an image of the riches and good life that awaits once he\\'s released.\\n\\n199. \"Green Light,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): R. Kelly sing-raps a warning to naysayers and fellow R&B crooners over a gnarly electric guitar. Beanie Sigel and Jay-Z lend their support by splitting a verse.\\n\\n198. \"MaNyfaCedGod,\" 4:44 (2017): If 4:44\\'s climax is its title track, in which Jay reveals and apologizes for his marital wrongdoings, then this two-part song is the resolution. On it, Hov discusses the healing and reconciliation process, candidly remembering the ways the turbulence in his marriage played out in the public (\"Look at all we been through since last August / Skating through the rumors like, \\'Aw, shit!\\'\"). He\\'s not as somber as he sounds on \"4:44\" -- at times he\\'s even playful and a little cerebral -- but Jay conveys the difficulty of continuing a relationship after someone majorly messes up.\\n\\n197. \"A Ballad for the Fallen Soldier,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): For the first half of his career, Jay-Z didn\\'t get enough credit for the conscious content implanted in his rhymes. This is one of his more overt examples -- over a dreary piano backdrop, he compares the plight of soldiers to that of street hustlers. It\\'s not the most novel analogy, but this post-9/11 metaphor is especially resonant: \"Bin Laden been happenin\\' in Manhattan / Crack was anthrax back then, back when / Police was Al-Qaeda to black men.\"\\n\\n196. \"Spiritual,\" Tidal (2016): The unfortunate reality about this plea for an end to police brutality is that it was recorded years before it hit the public, yet felt timely when it finally dropped as a response to the murders of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. \"I am not poison / Just a boy from the hood that / Got my hands in the air / In despair don\\'t shoot,\" he rhymes.\\n\\n195. \"What We Talkin\\' About,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): Jay clears the air to open his 11th solo studio album, shrugging off insignificant chatter over futuristic keys.\\n\\n194. \"Crown,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): It\\'s crazy to think that Jay-Z went from ducking police and clashing with enemies in the streets to participating in hip-hop battles that seemed ready to erupt into real-life violence to songs like this Travis Scott-assisted affair, in which he taunts a corporate rival: professional sports agent Scott Boras.\\n\\n193. \"The Streets,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): If anyone out there has a doctored, R. Kelly-free version of Best of Both Worlds, please tweet it to me @youngJFK. Thx!\\n\\n192. \"Crew Love,\" Belly: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1998): Jay-Z is relegated to hook duty here, supervising Roc underclassmen Memphis Bleek and the newly signed Beanie Sigel, who packs his verse with a bevy of clever Monopoly references.\\n\\n191. \"Face Off,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Jay-Z\\'s lyrics about love have evolved since releasing this hump-and-dump anthem with Sauce Money. They\\'re a formidable tag team no matter the subject matter, and the fun they\\'re having here is palpable.\\n\\n190. \"Minority Report,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A sullen, time-capsule take on the socioeconomic injustice of the U.S. government\\'s piss-poor Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Jay\\'s words make the song cry and Dr. Dre\\'s piano keys sound like teardrops.\\n\\n189. \"Snoopy Track,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Jay-Z\\'s fourth studio album continued hip-hop\\'s growing shift away from regionalism. He\\'d already shown love to burgeoning New Orleans star Juvenile by blessing his breakout single, \"Ha,\" with a complementary remix verse the previous year. Juvie returns the favor here, sing-rapping a gruff hook over Timbaland\\'s revved-up instrumental, while Jay\\'s tempered flow panders to Dirty South listeners, insisting, \"It\\'s for the black culture.\"\\n\\n188. \"There\\'s Been a Murder,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Jay-Z brings you back to the days before he was a world-known star, recalling shoot-outs and high-speed cop chases, and summing up his plight with this simile-metaphor hybrid: \"See my life is like a seesaw/ And until I move this weight it\\'s gon\\' keep me to the floor.\" It\\'s a morose three-and-a-half minutes that sink an often upbeat LP.\\n\\n187. \"Only a Customer,\" Streets Is Watching Soundtrack (1998): This song is built around an unexciting Mary J. Blige sample. But Jay\\'s lyrics are sharp as he contemplates whether the need for the finer things in life is worth the risks attached to selling weight.\\n\\n186. \"Anything,\" The Truth (2000): Jay hijacks a bonus slot on Beanie\\'s debut to house this heartfelt dedication to his mom, nephews, and musical and business partners. But it\\'s docked for it\\'s Oliver! sample, a formula jacked from \"Hard Knock Life\" that didn\\'t pay dividends the second time around.\\n\\n185. \"30 Something,\" Kingdom Come (2006): This was an awkward stage in Jay\\'s career. He boasts about his maturity, which entails everything from smoking Cuban cigars to maintaining an excellent credit score. Congrats? It\\'s elitist, but still, Jay\\'s lyrical interplay with Dr. Dre\\'s simple piano riff works.\\n\\n184. \"Somewhere in America,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): A rumination on cultural and socioeconomic politics -- basically, the tanning of America -- over a funky horn loop.\\n\\n183. \"Break Up to Make Up,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2001): Why angry, intense sex is the best: a special report by R.\\n\\nKelly and Jay-Z.\\n\\n182. \"Legacy,\" 4:44 (2017): Breezy horns add a sweet, mellow ambience to a track about maximizing generational wealth and erasing inherited family traumas.\\n\\n181. \"Party Life,\" American Gangster (2007): This song sounds nothing like its title suggests. Hov spits some fly-ass talk about his couture, superstar wife, and overall cool-guy quintessence, as he\\'s been known to do so effortlessly.\\n\\n180. \"Honey,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): Knowing R. Kelly\\'s real-life vices really reframes these collaborative projects, even making once-gleaming standouts like this one unlistenable.\\n\\n179. \"100$ Bill,\" The Great Gatsby: Music From Baz Luhrmann\\'s Film (2013): Over a frenetic E*Vax beat, Hov points out the hypocrisy behind man\\'s relationship with the almighty dollar. Unsurprisingly, there\\'s coke talk too. It\\'s a wonder that Jay is still finding new ways to rap about moving weight, playing on everyone from Albert Einstein to Marvin Gaye to Taylor Swift to metaphorically describe his past life.\\n\\n178. \"8 Miles and Running,\" 8 Mile: Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture (2002): Jay throws his success in the faces of those who doubted he\\'d find a fruitful career in music.\\n\\n177. \"Stop,\" Blueprint 2.1 (2003): Making hits seemed so easy for Hov around this time. This one might be forgotten among the surplus of turn-up tracks if it weren\\'t still a mainstay in the throwback portion of New York City DJs\\' party playlists.\\n\\n176. \"Oh My God,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A high-energy Just Blaze banger that feels like it\\'s seeking the combustible high of \"Public Service Announcement (Interlude)\" -- there\\'s that same buildup to hard drums and guitar stabs. On the track, Jay skims through his life story, from growing up without a father to sonning his rap competition.\\n\\n175. \"Jigga That Nigga,\" The Blueprint (2001): A rare but necessary deviation from the soul samples that shaped Jay-Z\\'s second classic LP. Poke and Tone cue up a catchy synth-based beat perfect for Jigga\\'s flossy rhymes (sample: \"I am, killing \\'em out there, they needing first aid / Cause the boy got more 6s than first grade\").\\n\\n174. \"That\\'s My Bitch,\" Watch the Throne (2011):\\n\\nThe Throne\\'s version of romance: Kanye lays claim to his ex-girlfriend Amber Rose, while Jay-Z offers Beyonc\\xe9 the ultimate compliment, insisting that her beauty belongs on the walls of museums (and simultaneously advocating for brown women to be exalted just as their white counterparts are already). The two rappers, with their different yet harmonious approaches, conquer a bubbly curveball of a beat by Q-Tip.\\n\\n173. \"Who Gon Stop Me,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Jay completely obliterates this erratic Flux Pavilion sample, sounding not at all amazed when recalling how he ascended from the dirt to rolling in dough.\\n\\n172. \"Ride or Die,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): Without saying his name, Jay snapped back at Mase here, addressing some of the Harlem rapper slash pastor\\'s disrespectful talk on 112\\'s \"Love Me.\" It\\'s an early indication of Hov\\'s battling ferocity, along with a glowing self-endorsement: \"S. Carter, ghostwriter / And for the right price, I can even make yo\\' shit tighter.\"\\n\\n171. \"Celebration,\" Streets Is Watching Soundtrack (1998): The opening lines of Jigga\\'s blistering diss \"Takeover\" originated on this Roc-A-Fella 1.0 posse cut. He, along with Memphis Bleek, Sauce Money, and Wais P of Da Ranjahz, does this Commodores track of the same name proud.\\n\\n170. \"Open Letter,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Jay-Z almost got Obama in trouble with this loosie that addresses his trip to Cuba with Beyonc\\xe9 to celebrate their wedding anniversary (before travel restrictions were lifted). Jay gloriously trolled Republicans: \"Boy from the hood but got White House clearance,\" causing former press secretary Jay Carney to hold a press conference denying that the former president had communicated with Hov about his travel arrangements.\\n\\n169. \"Gangsta Shit,\" The Professional (1998): Before the stick-up anthem that put 50 Cent on the map, Jay-Z dropped this graphic track alongside Ja Rule teaching you how to rob.\\n\\n168. \"Show You How,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): A seminar for the swaggerless on how to live your life like Shawn Carter, over a warped Just Blaze instrumental.\\n\\n167. \"Dope Man,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Ironically, Jay ended up in trouble with the law around the time of the release of this extended metaphor comparing his musical rise to a high-profile criminal trial. He\\'d stabbed producer and executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera at New York City\\'s Kit Kat Club -- reportedly over his alleged bootlegging of Vol. 3 -- and was soon facing 15 years in prison if convicted. But life didn\\'t completely imitate art. Unlike his dramatic victory in \"Dope Man,\" Jigga copped a plea deal for three years of probation.\\n\\n166. \"Can I Live II,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): Despite being a forced continuation of the legendary original, Jay and Bleek get some solid lines off, so we\\'ll let them live.\\n\\n165. \"If I Should Die,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): An optimistic look at life and death over a beat by Swizz that shifts away from the delightfully simple chord patterns that defined his early productions.\\n\\n164. \"Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2),\" The Blueprint (2001): Kanye picked the perfect Persuaders sample to bless this glorified remix that\\'s smoother than its more popular original. Jay nods to classic Lil Kim and Biggie lines while describing his ideal woman -- \"pretty, witty, girly, worldly\" -- criteria that still grace Instagram bios to this day.\\n\\n163. \"Come and Get Me,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): The one-minute intro to this song shines brightest, as Jay makes clear just how comfortable he is with handling and using his gun. Timbaland\\'s hard, bouncy beat regrettably switches up into something a bit smoother; still, Jay invites all challengers eyeing his crown, insisting they\\'d have to take it in blood.\\n\\n162. \"People\\'s Court,\" Backstage: A Hard Knock Life (2000): The most clever of Jay\\'s songs based on the judiciary system, \"People\\'s Court\" flips courtroom terminology in a primer on street justice (\"Save your opening arguments, hope you understanding / Two guns, right over left, that\\'s how I crossexamine\"). The song samples the theme music from its titular TV series, but Jay neglects to name-drop another Brooklyn-born hardass: the Honorable Judge Judy.\\n\\n161. \"Some People Hate,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Known for quoting Biggie throughout his career, Jay borrows lyrics from Tupac Shakur on this one, as he lashes back at those who\\'ve resented his success. Kanye West\\'s sped sample adds some sunniness.\\n\\n160. \"Oceans,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): This song\\'s concept is interesting enough -- Jay juxtaposes the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and indentured servitude with the life of luxuriousness that he\\'s living in the 21st century. The radical thoughts and ideas here can sound disjointed at times, like a concept that\\'s not fully fleshed out.\\n\\n159. \"Beach Chair,\" Kingdom Come (2006): This deep musing set to Chris Martin\\'s spacey instrumental is the most experimental track in Jay-Z\\'s catalogue. Penned in part as a letter to his unborn daughter, \"Beach Chair\" is a meditation on happiness, karma, and life\\'s purpose.\\n\\n158. \"Family Feud,\" 4:44 (2017): Jay-Z has done his share of old-man cane shaking at hip-hop\\'s younger generation in the second half of his career, but here he comes to a place of acceptance, calling for unity among hip-hop artists, and, more generally, black people. Beyonc\\xe9\\'s background vocals shine through as well.\\n\\n157. \"Sweet,\" American Gangster (2007): There\\'s a cycle that can permeate impoverished communities -- one that finds a younger generation following in the footsteps of older figures who go illegal to live regal. Jay examines that repetition, mulling over the influence of his own criminal activities on the nephews who look up to him.\\n\\n156. \"The Bounce,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Kanye West doesn\\'t squander his first full verse alongside his rap idol. Timbaland provides a funky instrumental that beats at your eardrums, and Kanye takes full advantage, warping in and out of character, stretching his voice and flow with a rubber band\\'s elasticity, and staking claim to past beat-making contributions to hip-hop history [\"Izzo (H.O.V.A.),\" \"Takeover\"].\\n\\n155. \"The Ruler\\'s Back,\" The Blueprint (2001): A proper homage that re-creates Slick Rick\\'s 1988 song of the same name over a new set of trumpets, setting a celebratory tone for The Blueprint; it\\'s like a premature victory lap.\\n\\n154. \"FuckWithMeYouKnowIGotIt,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Jay-Z reportedly lifted his verse from a shelved Watch the Throne track called \"Living So Italian\" for this luxury rap meets trap knocker that\\'s likely to blow out your AirPods.\\n\\n153. \"Illest Motherfucker Alive,\" Watch the Throne (2011): In case you can\\'t tell by this song\\'s title, modesty is not the Throne\\'s strong suit. \"Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses / My house like a museum so I see \\'em when I\\'m peeing,\" Jay rhymes, humble as ever, over a deep cello and sparkling keys.\\n\\n152. \"Stick 2 the Script,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): This tough-talking duet between Beanie Sigel and Jay-Z feels redundant on The Dynasty -- the similar but stronger \"Streets Is Talking\" appears three tracks earlier -- but it\\'s still dope.\\n\\n151. \"Already Home,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): In one of Jay\\'s strongest rap performances on The Blueprint 3, he explains, in an impressive variety of ways, how he\\'s several levels above any other living rapper.\\n\\n150. \"The Watcher 2,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Jay really likes sequels. This one finds him in the driver\\'s seat, inviting Rakim and Dr. Dre, who recorded the original track, along for the ride. Perhaps the rehash was a passive-aggressive play by Hov, though -- Nas is rumored to have written Dre\\'s 1999 prequel.\\n\\n149. \"Picasso Baby,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Probably the best product of Jay-Z\\'s art-collecting obsession. The electric guitar-powered beat during the second half would sound at home on Vol. 1, in the best way.\\n\\n148. \"Poppin\\' Tags,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): You might\\'ve felt short-changed when this long-awaited Hova and OutKast collaboration finally happened -- and Andr\\xe9 3000 was absent. But Twista and Killer Mike join Jay and Big Boi for a knocking ode to shopping sprees over a brilliantly chopped Marvelettes sample, courtesy of the Louis Vuitton Don himself, Kanye West.\\n\\n147. \"I Know,\" American Gangster (2007): Leave it to Jay-Z and Pharrell to record a song about heroin and the destructiveness of addiction, and turn it into an entirely different kind of hit.\\n\\n146.\"Rap Game / Crack Game,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Hov puts up the split screen once again, drawing parallels between the two vocations he knows best. Turns out, they\\'re not all that different.\\n\\n145. \"Blue Magic,\" American Gangster (2007): Rakim guests here, too, albeit only in spirit. Over a minimalist Neptunes beat, Jay pays homage to Rakim Allah with several references to the hip-hop legend\\'s song \"My Melody.\"\\n\\n144. \"Hovi Baby,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Jay-Z took a month-long vacation in the South of France between the 2002 releases of The Best of Both Worlds and The Blueprint\\xb2. He returned home to a mess. Roc-A-Fella co-founder Damon Dash made a bunch of personnel changes at the label without Jay\\'s consent -- most notably, promoting Beanie Sigel and Cam\\'ron to vice-presidents, a point of contention that placed a wedge between the former partners. Also, Nas had tried to lynch an effigy of his former rival at Summer Jam before being blocked by Hot 97. One of Jay\\'s first orders of business after coming home was to visit Funkmaster Flex at the radio station and drop a ceremonial freestyle on the airwaves, previewing the second verse of this song. He keeps that same rejuvenated timbre on \"Hovi Baby,\" also injecting the sternness of an annoyed king displeased with the state of his kingdom and threatening to go full tyrant. \"In my absence / cats get / absent-minded,\" he rhymes, dropping the gavel over a Just Blaze instrumental that sounds like it belongs on an \\'80s TV game show.\\n\\n143. \"The Best of Both Worlds,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): This song\\'s title rings true as Jay and Kellz trade the mic back-and-forth, ringing in their first duet album. R. Kelly\\'s singing is over-the-top at times, but it works.\\n\\n142. \"Guilty Until Proven Innocent,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Jay raps about the injustice of being a celebrity undergoing a criminal trial -- his felony assault charges for stabbing Lance Rivera were still outstanding -- and invited R. Kelly, of all people, to sing about innocence.\\n\\n141. \"Caught Their Eyes,\" 4:44 (2017): Jay acknowledges how the same intuition that\\'s kept him one step ahead of peril in the streets now helps him navigate the corporate world, in the process ripping into the head of Prince\\'s estate, taking to a peppy No ID beat to address some Tidal beef.\\n\\n140. \"Squeeze 1st,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Jay\\'s flow is super loose over this Rick Rock loop, which sounds like it\\'s straight out of a video game from the \\'90s. He goes at it for less than four minutes, but I could listen to Hov spit over this beat for hours.\\n\\n139. \"A Week Ago,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): Jay-Z is a master at humanizing tales from the hood. Here, he opens up about a close friend and fellow hustler who snitched once he got snagged by police. Jay\\'s delivery when rapping about his turncoat friend -- reportedly estranged homie DeHaven Irby -- is cold, but you get the feeling he\\'s hurt by the betrayal. \"When he called collect and I heard his name / I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone / He\\'s talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone,\" he rhymes. It\\'s a needed personal touch on an album stacked to the brim with hits.\\n\\n138. \"American Dreamin,\\'\" American Gangster (2007): This song sounds just as dreamy as its title suggests, with its delightful Marvin Gaye sample. Jay is a ghetto griot here, sharing a story about how a group of tenacious kids with big aspirations and limited options find themselves in the coke game.\\n\\n137. \"Watch Me,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): There\\'s an endearing carpe diem outlook here, although present-day Jay-Z probably cringes listening back on sterling financial advice like \"Save for what? Ball till your days is up.\"\\n\\n136. \"It\\'s Alright,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life/Streets Is Watching Soundtrack (1998): Some posturing from Memphis Bleek and an on-the-verge Jay-Z that\\'s amplified by cool whirring sounds lifted from Kraftwerk\\'s \"The Hall of Mirrors.\"\\n\\n135. \"Primetime,\" Watch the Throne (2011): A gratuitous Watch the Throne bonus track that showcases a complex numerically themed verse from Jay alongside the usual improper humor from Yeezy over No I.D.\\'s shimmery piano.\\n\\n134. \"Soon You\\'ll Understand,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): This feels like a first draft of \"Song Cry,\" particularly this track\\'s middle verse, which wrestles with themes of love, loyalty, and maturity. It\\'s one of three fictionalized scenarios that Jay delivers with believable emotion over a haunting instrumental; the common thread is a plea for empathy.\\n\\n133. \"Adnis,\" 4:44 (2017): Like a page out of Jay-Z\\'s diary -- or an exercise assigned by his therapist -- this open letter asks his late father questions that have no answers, over a piano melody that seems to trip over itself. \"Must\\'ve been some pain in your past, too / Must\\'ve been a karma that was past due,\" he rhymes. The song ends in a place of peace, acceptance, and forgiveness.\\n\\n132. \"NYMP,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): A knocking dedication to Marcy Projects that plays like a lite sequel to \"Where I\\'m From.\"\\n\\n131. \"Parking Lot Pimpin,\\'\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Why waste time within the confines of a crowded club when you can create your own scene in the parking lot? Jay, Beans, and Bleek indulge their love for hot wheels over a thumping beat, saluting the road warriors and auto aficionados who know the real party goes down at the let out.\\n\\n130. \"Pray,\" American Gangster (2007): This introduction to American Gangster plays on the parallels between Jay-Z\\'s hustler past and the Denzel Washington-starring film of the same name (itself based on the life of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas). Close your eyes and listen to Jay\\'s narrative; it\\'s like a movie in itself.\\n\\n129. \"Real As It Gets,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): This triumphant record was originally intended for Young Jeezy\\'s TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition before Hov snagged it for his own project. It\\'s a nice score, a bright spot on an uneven third Blueprint album.\\n\\n128. \"Streets Is Talking,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Aside from maybe Sauce Money, no one brings grittier street reportage out of Jay-Z than Beanie Sigel. What could\\'ve been an underwhelming update to \"Streets Is Watching\" shines as Sigel raps right up until the beat ends, closing with an aggressive a cappella.\\n\\n127. \"Say Hello,\" American Gangster (2007): Jay plays the villain role here, taking a defensive tone as he justifies the criminal route he chose while evoking the moments just before Tony Montana (Scarface) and Frank Lucas (American Gangster) began their respective falls from drug-lord glory. DJ Toomp provides a stirring, cinematic backdrop -- these two really should work together again.\\n\\n126. \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Kanye allows Jay to take the lead here, rapping from his therapist\\'s couch about loss and depression -- a surprising turn on an album that\\'s often preoccupied with excess and grandiosity.\\n\\n125. \"I Got the Keys,\" Major Key (2016): On paper, Jay-Z and Future make for curious collaborators. But music matchmaker DJ Khaled paired them up proper, allowing Hendrix to lay down an inescapable hook and Hov to spit cloth talk of only the highest thread count.\\n\\n124. \"No Hook,\" American Gangster (2007): The-Dream made it a hot line; Jay made it a hot song. Hov lifts a memorable lyric from \"Shawty Is Da Shit\" to tie together three tough verses of his own.\\n\\n123. \"Gotta Have It,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Even more impressive than Jay rapping about planking on a million dollars or the palpable chemistry he shares with Kanye on the mic is that \\'Ye and Pharrell chop up three (!) different James Brown samples and lay them down over a mesmerizing loop for one of Watch the Throne\\'s most enjoyable tracks.\\n\\n122. \"Thank You,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): This song closes with an extended metaphor about rappers whose album sales are not up to snuff; despite needlessly evoking 9/11 imagery, it\\'s wonderful.\\n\\n121. \"Success,\" American Gangster (2007): Nas and Jay-Z have yet to deliver a truly classic duet, but this No I.D.-produced heater comes damn close. Over a crescendoing organ riff, the two rap legends grumble about the misfortunes that come along with being filthy rich. Nas sneaks in a subliminal potshot about his newfound friendship and business alliance with his former archnemesis (he signed to the Jay-Z-led Def Jam Records in 2006): \"Worst enemies wanna be my best friends / Best friends wanna be enemies like that\\'s what\\'s in / But I don\\'t give a fuck, walk inside the lion\\'s den / Take everybody\\'s chips, about to cash them in.\"\\n\\n120. \"So Ambitious,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): The Neptunes and Jay-Z make magic more often than not. These horn flourishes and xylophone taps are the perfect sound-bed for a retelling of how a kid from Marcy Projects massively succeeded against all odds.\\n\\n119. \"People Talkin\\',\" Jay-Z: Unplugged (2002): Ski\\'s pounding boom-bap and Jay-Z\\'s endless lyrical warning shots make the perfect marriage for this bonus track that really belongs on a proper studio release.\\n\\n118. \"Hola Hovito,\" The Blueprint (2001): An upbeat Timbaland-produced banger that tempers The Blueprint\\'s heavy soul offerings and panders to Latino listeners without completely butchering the Spanish language.\\n\\n117. \"Somebody\\'s Girl,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): Jay-Z may have been the original Mr. Steal Your Girl -- this catchy track from his ill-fated duet LP with R. Kelly is all about the art of being \"the other guy.\" The song is savage, bumped up five notches for the heavy allusions to Martin Lawrence\\'s classic stand-up comedy film You So Crazy in verse three.\\n\\n116. \"Smile,\" 4:44 (2017): This track is immediately important for its powerful revelation that Jay-Z\\'s mother identifies as a lesbian. But what\\'s most impressive is the extended closing verse, in which Jay runs down the many ways he\\'s prevailed in various industries simply by being his own boss.\\n\\n115. \"Jay-Z Blue,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Before the fateful elevator ride gone viral, Jay gave a peek at the cracks forming in his family life. It\\'s the most candid four minutes on the album -- Jay goes through a range of emotions, from wanting more time with his wife and daughter to needing a three-week vacation from it all to wondering if his own dad\\'s bad (or absent) parenting is hereditary. Jay is nervous, unsure, maybe even neurotic -- a type of vulnerability previously unseen, a tip of the transparency iceberg that was to come.\\n\\n114. \"American Gangster,\" American Gangster (2007): Producers Sean C & LV, along with Diddy, steered the majority of the music on American Gangster, creating a moody atmosphere for Jay to deliver his Frank Lucas-inspired storyline. The sonic parameters are appropriate, but on this bonus cut -- over Just Blaze\\'s sunny Curtis Mayfield sample from the same era -- Jay sounds like an emcee unleashed, rapping with more energy than anywhere else on the entire project.\\n\\n113. \"Some How Some Way,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): Putting Beanie Sigel, Jay-Z, and Scarface on the same track had already proved to be a promising formula after the release of \"This Can\\'t Be Life\" and \"Guess Who\\'s Back.\" They keep the winning streak going with this mellifluous retrospective about escaping poverty.\\n\\n112. \"Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise),\" The Blueprint (2001): A bout of wordplay aerobics using workout terms; will help get you through leg day.\\n\\n111. \"Heaven,\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): Hov questions religion in a truly curious way, examining the morality and validity of denominational teachings. It\\'s a tension he\\'s played with throughout his career; here he evokes religious symbolism with lines like, \"Y\\'all dwell on devil shit, I\\'m in a Diablo,\" and \"Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus.\"\\n\\n110. \"From Marcy to Hollywood,\" The Players Club Soundtrack (1998): Sauce Money, Memphis Bleek, and Jay-Z are three the hard way. The Marcy lyricists narrate scenarios that prove in the streets, wolves can take on many different forms.\\n\\n109. \"What the Game Made Me,\" I Got the Hook-Up Soundtrack (1998): Three the hard way come harder over twinkling chimes, although Bleek shines brightest this time.\\n\\n108. \"Who You Wit\"/\"Who You Wit II,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): This is just a bunch of slick pimp talk over Ski\\'s jazzy piano and guitar sample. The opening gambit -- \"I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches / Rough bitches, don\\'t matter you my bitches\" -- recalls Ice-T\\'s \"99 Problems,\" which Jay would later recreate in 2003.\\n\\n107. \"Ignorant Shit,\" American Gangster (2007): Just Blaze whips up a timeless Isley Brothers track for Jay to clap back at hip-hop detractors and mock listeners who find his thoughtful songs too sophisticated. Most memorable, though, is his confirmation that most rappers are faker than a $4 bill, not unlike WWE wrestlers: \"Don\\'t fear no rappers / They\\'re all weirdos, De Niros in practice.\" Then, with a wink, Jay includes himself in the assessment. \"Actually, believe half of what you see / None of what you hear, even if it\\'s spat by me / And with that said, I will kill niggas dead.\" The 2005 leak of this song is the best version, though, adding an alternate closing verse from Jay in place of Beanie Sigel.\\n\\n106. \"Diamond Is Forever,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): The type of chant-along Roc-A-Fella anthem that\\'s perfect for throwing your diamond in the sky if you feel the vibe.\\n\\n105. \"Shining,\" Grateful (2017): This song marked Jay-Z and Beyonc\\xe9\\'s first collaboration since 2013\\'s \"Drunk in Love.\" On this joyous, up-tempo DJ Khaled cut, they toast to their extensive winning streaks, offering not even the slightest hint of the sobering 4:44 that would follow months later.\\n\\n104. \"Money Ain\\'t a Thang,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): This is a soundtrack for bad financial decisions, and the aspirational hit single with Jermaine Dupri that set the stage for Jay-Z\\'s impending hip-hop takeover. To think, at the time of this song\\'s release Jay was probably pulling somewhere in the ballpark of one percent of his estimated 2017 $810 million net worth (that is, $8.1 million).\\n\\n103. \"Fallin\\'\" American Gangster (2007): Jay evokes the misery of a crumbling criminal empire -- the typical tale of a hustler who doesn\\'t know when to stop pushing his luck -- over a melancholy piano-based melody by JD.\\n\\n102. \"The Joy,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Jay and Kanye, as usual, take different approaches over this peak nostalgia Pete Rock track (somehow, it\\'s the legendary producer\\'s first collaboration with Hov). While Kanye rotates women and extols the merits of birth-control pills, Jay gives all glory to Gloria Carter, his mom.\\n\\n101. \"Blueprint 2,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): An overlooked attack in Jay\\'s battle with Nas. There are some effective blows here (he calls Nas\\'s brother, Jungle, a \"garden\"), but Hov gets docked for the dated and silly Austin Powers references in the hook.\\n\\n100. \"Show Me What You Got,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A fun, youthful introduction to the maturity and grown-folks business that comprises much of Kingdom Come.\\n\\n99. \"Bam,\" 4:44 (2017): With Brooklyn\\'s dense West Indian demographic, it\\'s shocking how seldom Jay-Z has collided with reggae artists or hopped on dancehall-inspired riddims. Sure, Sean Paul appeared on The Blueprint\\xb2 and yeah, he tacked a verse onto the remix of Mavado\\'s \"On the Rock\" in 2008, but this majestic Damian Marley duet -- with nods to Sister Nancy and Inner Circle classics -- is as Kingston as you\\'ll find on this list. It\\'s a welcome voyage.\\n\\n98. \"Kingdom Come,\" Kingdom Come (2006): Back when hip-hop\\'s King of New York crown still meant something, Hov returned from his pseudo-retirement to lock it down once again. Just Blaze scrambled up a ridiculous sample of Rick James\\'s \"Super Freak\" for Shawn Carter to announce his return -- and namedrop a bunch of comic-book heroes in the process.\\n\\n97. \"Meet the Parents,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): This piano-sprinkled allegory is often presented as evidence of Jay-Z\\'s storytelling ability -- I\\'m partial to his \"Coming of Age\" and \"Friend or Foe\" dilogies instead. It\\'s not that \"Meet the Parents\" isn\\'t a quality tale; there\\'s solid use of apprehension, plot twist, imagery, and irony. But the track is heavy-handed in its execution, an approach that Jay reveals was intentional in his book, Decoded. \"It was a morality play,\" says Jay, \"a PSA for that generation of men who may as well have emptied their guns on their sons when they left their lives.\"\\n\\n96. \"Blueprint (Momma Loves Me),\" The Blueprint (2001): What separates Jay-Z from other lyrically gifted, hit-making emcees -- like, say, Fabolous -- is his willingness to go in-depth about his struggles and successes. In this autobiographical track, he reels off names of loved ones who\\'ve shaped his life in ways small (\"Annie shampooed my hair\") and big (\"Jaz made me believe this shit was real\"). It all helps to nurture the connection between the artist and listener, a closeness that\\'s only grown as Jay\\'s career has progressed.\\n\\n95. \"December 4th,\" The Black Album (2003): With help from his mom, Jay-Z sums up his pre-stardom life in three verses. It\\'s a captivating audio memoir set to a stirring Just Blaze beat.\\n\\n94. \"Change the Game,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): By the time Dynasty dropped, the Roc\\'s core was solid: Beanie Sigel brought imposing wordplay with finesse, Memphis Bleek was all energy and agility, and Jay moved like the boss, with a cool delivery and top-notch lyricism. The trio brings exactly that over this bouncy Rick Rock production -- the best example of their gratifying synergy.\\n\\n93. \"Dear Summer,\" 534 (2005): Reasonable Doubt was supposed to be Jay-Z\\'s first and only album. But as his storied career proves, he could never definitively say good-bye to music. He attempted to on this track, addressing a farewell letter to the summer months that he\\'d once regularly dominated. Something about these sped-up piano keys, lifted from Weldon Irvine\\'s \"Morning Sunrise,\" suggest sincerity, but this ended up being more of a \"see ya later.\"\\n\\n92. \"Marcy Me,\" 4:44 (2017): You might have to rewind Jay\\'s agile flow -- easily 4:44\\'s most nimble display -- to catch all of the puns, but it\\'s worth it to witness this dazzling lyrical performance in all of its glory.\\n\\n91. \"Girls, Girls, Girls,\" The Blueprint (2001):\\n\\nJay-Z preys on cultural stereotypes to describe his many women and -- perhaps most shamefully -- reveals himself to be a viewer of sophomoric comedy flick Deuce Bigalow. Still, the chipmunked Tom Brock sample is undeniable.\\n\\n90. \"Kill Jay Z,\" 4:44 (2017): This isn\\'t the first time Jay-Z has killed himself, or rather his likeness, via his art. He depicts his assassination in the video for \"99 Problems,\" and repeats \"Jay-Z is dead\" in \"There\\'s Been a Murder.\" But this song is different. Jay singles out his ego, separating himself from the persona that led him to shoot his own brother as a young teen, or cheat on his wife. It\\'s an interesting lens through which to observe the indiscretions he details on 4:44 -- he\\'s taking accountability while simultaneously distancing himself for his most shameful actions, emerging on the other side a new and better man.\\n\\n89. \"The Story of O.J.\" 4:44 (2017): A prudent look at the role of the black elite -- underlined by the sample of Nina Simone\\'s racially significant \"Four Women\" -- that uses disgraced former football legend O.J. Simpson as a worst-case scenario. Jay pays it forward, urging listeners to strive for investment, ownership, and wealth that can be passed down to descendants.\\n\\n88. \"The Prelude,\" Kingdom Come (2006): When this number opened Jay-Z\\'s big \"comeback\" album, it seemed like Marcy\\'s begotten son might\\'ve had another classic album on deck. It turned out that couldn\\'t have been further from the truth. But producer B-Money helped make a solid first impression by hooking up an alluring clarinet melody that could charm a cobra. Hov slithers about, lamenting the plummeting stock of rap lyricism. It\\'s a memorable album intro, Hov\\'s own State of the Union address.\\n\\n87. \"03 Bonnie & Clyde,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002):\\n\\nJay remakes Tupac Shakur\\'s \"Me and My Girlfriend\" -- all about his relationship with a gun -- in the most literal way possible: by converting it into a duet with his real-life then-girlfriend, Beyonc\\xe9. Still, with its romantic guitar and cutesy inside jokes (\"Only time we don\\'t speak is during Sex and the City\"), the song was the perfect way to capitalize on the rumor mill churning about Jayonc\\xe9 with their undeniable first collaboration.\\n\\n86. \"Intro/A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Two thumping beats by DJ Premier plus two stellar verses by Jay-Z equals one impressive sophomore-album opening statement that puts an iconic Aaliyah sample to good use.\\n\\n85. \"Why I Love You,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Kanye and Jay seem genuinely hurt when discussing former friends -- particularly beneficiaries of their influence -- who\\'ve switched sides. \"Wasn\\'t I a good king?\" Jay asks. \"Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?\" \\'Ye answers. Mr. Hudson redeems himself for \"Young Forever\" with a fitting vocal on the hook.\\n\\n84. \"Hey Papi,\" The Klumps Soundtrack (2000): Timbaland and Jay were at their creative peak at the turn of the century. Over a zany, overloaded instrumental, Hov opens up to the idea of a romantic relationship that doesn\\'t end 15 minutes after intercourse.\\n\\nAmil\\'s unique voice add a minor, but winning touch.\\n\\n83. \"Never Change,\" The Blueprint (2001): The life of a drug dealer can sound glamorous -- that is, until you misplace or otherwise fuck up 92 kilos of cocaine. Over Kanye\\'s genius David Ruffin vocal chop, Jay recalls how he \"crawled back\" from a major L in less than one workweek. Is he full of shit? Who knows. Regardless, the anecdotal aside successfully builds the urban legend of Brooklyn\\'s most famous reformed pusher.\\n\\n82. \"All I Need,\" The Blueprint (2001): Jay adds a light touch to the more serious back half of The Blueprint with a tour rider for his everyday life.\\n\\n81. \"It\\'s Like That,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): Jay seasons a gorgeously simple Kid Capri beat with clever lines like, \"Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers.\"\\n\\n80. \"Intro,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): One of Jay\\'s most beloved album intros, bolstered by Just Blaze\\'s bedazzling instrumental. Every line here has purpose, introspection, and wit, as he drops layered rhymes about his money-focused mentality -- and how swiftly his riches (and life) could be snatched away if he\\'s not cautious.\\n\\n79. \"Threat,\" The Black Album (2003): It seems like Jay lists all 6 million ways to die (by his own hands) over 9th Wonder\\'s masterful chop of \"A Woman\\'s Threat\" by R. Kelly. This gets bumped up ten spots for Cedric the Entertainer\\'s comic relief.\\n\\n78. \"Cashmere Thoughts,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): This song started out as a joke. Jay had a pimp name and persona -- Cashmere Jones -- that he employs here, setting out to drop the slickest rhymes he could think of. Which explains ridiculous and ruthless lines like, \"I pimp hard on a trick, look / Fuck if your leg broke, bitch, hop up on your good foot,\" rapped over Clark Kent\\'s smooth production.\\n\\n77. \"Made in America,\" Watch the Throne (2011): This song was originally titled \"Sweet Baby Jesus,\" but there\\'s a dual meaning at play in the official title that subtly accentuates Kanye and Jay\\'s intentions. The surface interpretation is \"American-made,\" as if to say the two rappers are products of all of the glory, hypocrisy, and injustice of the U.S. -- the testimonies of their respective come-ups on this track are tied to that heritage. Alternatively, the title could imply that the two superstars are \"made,\" as in financially loaded, as an outcome of their groundwork. Either way, this is another masterful pairing with the great Frank Ocean.\\n\\n76. \"Glory (B.I.C.)\" (2012): A heartwarming track celebrating Jay-Z and Beyonc\\xe9\\'s first child, Blue Ivy Carter, who was born just days before this song\\'s release. The Neptunes provide soothing synths and keys that are lullaby-ready, while Jay raps pure joy, reminiscent of Stevie Wonder\\'s dedication to his daughter on \"Isn\\'t She Lovely.\" Hov alludes to some heavy moments as well -- a past miscarriage, and the deaths of his dad and singer-friend Aaliyah -- but by the end of the runtime you\\'re left marveling about how adorable (and spoiled!) Blue Ivy is gonna be.\\n\\n75. \"In My Lifetime,\" SingleCK (1995CK): A single from deep in the Shawn Carter catalog with shadows of his speedy flow, but mostly characterized by a poised delivery. His skill is undeniable here, as he raps about his need for money by any means, seemingly not yet 100 percent sold on rap as a full-time hustle.\\n\\n74. \"My 1st Song,\" The Black Album (2003): Bye-bye Jigga, again. This Black Album adieu sounds like a tropical vacation, with dancing strings that Jay skips across in double-time. The spoken outro may or may not have inspired Kanye to rant at the end of The College Dropout.\\n\\n73. \"You, Me, Him, and Her,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): This mesmerizing instrumental by producer Bink was easily one of that year\\'s most coveted, thanks in large part to the verses the varsity Roc lineup lays down. Bleek, Beanie, Jay, and Amil -- who gets just a scant six bars, poor Amil -- are at their most synergetic, combining like Power Rangers\\' Megazord, or, better yet, a sturdy hip-hop crew.\\n\\n72. \"On to the Next One,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): Jay fancies himself a trendsetter over this otherworldly head-nodder of a Swizz beat, accomplishing here where \"Off That\" failed.\\n\\n71. \"I Can\\'t Get Wit Dat,\" B-Side (1995): There\\'s something refreshing about the way that Jay-Z speed-raps through this single from his early rhyming days. Lyrically, it\\'s just a bunch of bragging about being a supreme emcee. But the way he puts his words together is so irresistible -- at one point Jay mouths the sound of a money counter, hitting each syllable like a stone skipping across a lake.\\n\\n70. \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): A tale of a disgruntled hustler who\\'s hungry for a bigger cut of his OG\\'s earnings. The illest thing about this continuation from Reasonable Doubt\\'s symbolic origin story is that Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek stretch out a 30-second encounter into a four-minute song, with all of the tension of a muscle knot. The bulk of the action takes place in their minds, building up with suspense and ending in reality -- a promising musical career for Bleek.\\n\\n69. \"Take You Home With Me a.k.a. Body,\" The Best of Both Worlds (2002): In retrospect, I\\'m starting to believe that R. Kelly\\'s \"home\" is the original Sunken Place. Jay leads the way here, though, spitting the type of one-liners that might dominate your Twitter feed had this song dropped today. He discusses how a woman\\'s curves \"make it hard to watch a flat TV,\" exposes denims \"that make objects bigger than they appear like a rear-view mirror,\" and establishes the official wifey uniform: a powder-blue Rocawear velour suit and white Nikes. The beat, which sounds like a monophonic 8-bit ringtone, burrows its way into your brain -- these days, it evokes the early-2000s perfectly.\\n\\n68. \"Brooklyn Go Hard,\" Notorious (Music from and Inspired by the Original Motion Picture) (2009): There hasn\\'t been a prouder, more brash BK anthem in the nearly ten years since this song dropped. Jay\\'s opening patois could use some coaching, but his lyrical Ginsu is sharp -- witness how he brilliantly deconstructs and reconfigures baseball legend Jackie Robinson\\'s name for his own indulgent purposes. Santigold\\'s sung hook and bridge are 24 karat.\\n\\n67. \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune),\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): The futurist Blueprint 3 is all about progression, but here Jay-Z longs for the past: bygone days when, according to him, pitch-correction software didn\\'t compensate for lack of creativity in hip-hop. His moratorium was issued over an insane guitar-and-brass medley that was just begging to be sampled.\\n\\n66. \"It\\'s Hot (Some Like It Hot),\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Hov counters 50 Cent\\'s jab on \"How to Rob\" with a piercing dart on a song that lives up to its name: \"I\\'m about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cent?\" Touch\\xe9.\\n\\n65. \"This Life Forever,\" Black Gangster Soundtrack (1999): An underrated and overlooked jewel in Jay-Z\\'s discography.\\n\\nWith \\xdcber-witty punch lines and wordplay, he illustrates stark portraits of the projects, summing things up with a sobering conclusion: \"Let\\'s face it / Either you\\'re dough chasing or basing.\"\\n\\n64. \"1-900-Hustler,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): Hov jacked this concept -- a hotline phone service that provides nefarious advice for starry-eyed criminals -- from Houston duo Convicts\\' 1995 song \"1-900-Dial-A-Crook,\" which features Geto Boys. But this Roc classic is most significant for introducing the world to Freeway. His elevated vocal pitch is sui generis. The way he modulates between some syllables (\"hus-tel-ers,\" \"cus-to-mers\") and elongates others (\"F-R / Two E\\'s / That\\'ll be two G\\'s\") are like extensions of the beat. And Free\\'s street commandments are coded, succinct, and sound counsel that you should definitely not try at home -- all the makings of a timeless first outing.\\n\\n63. \"La-La-La (Excuse Me Miss Again),\" Blueprint 2.1 (2003): Rather than a remix, this is a complete reimagining of the genteel \"Excuse Me Miss.\" The Neptunes cook up some humming synths and soft bongos for Jay to stroke his own ego in rhyme.\\n\\n62. \"Reservoir Dogs,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): When you\\'re rhyming in a cypher of this caliber, there\\'s zero room for a shaky flow or trash punch line. You\\'ll find neither on this high-stakes posse cut. Every verse here deserves a flame emoji -- but leaving it at that is no fun. So here goes, verses ranked from best to least-best: Sauce Money, Styles P, Jay-Z, Jadakiss, Sheek Louch, Beanie Sigel.\\n\\n61. \"No Church in the Wild,\" Watch the Throne (2011):\\n\\nPropelled by an urgent bass line, Kanye and Jay-Z offer strikingly different musings on religion. Jay contemplates ancient Socratic philosophy, while Kanye praises polygamy, cocaine, and Red Bull. Frank Ocean ties it all together by singing a string of rhetorical questions, but sounds great nonetheless.\\n\\n60. \"Bring It On,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): Jay-Z envisioned Nas and AZ co-starring on this Reasonable Doubt deep cut, which, needless to say, could\\'ve been an NYC collaboration for the ages, right up there with his Biggie-featured \"Brooklyn\\'s Finest\" from the same album. Still, Sauce Money, Jaz-O, and Jigga all bring A-game bravado to DJ Premier\\'s sleepy violin and pummeling boom-bap.\\n\\n59. \"Heart of the City (Ain\\'t No Love),\" The Blueprint (2001): A song about the big bull\\'s-eye that appears on your back once you\\'ve reached the top of your class. Whereas Jay is usually combative when discussing haters, he sounds incredulous here, wondering what he\\'s done to deserve such icy treatment. Thank god Kanye gave Hov this beat -- built around a rousing Bobby \"Blue\" Bland sample -- and not DMX, as \\'Ye has said was the original plan.\\n\\n58. \"What More Can I Say,\" The Black Album (2003): Jay hops on an exuberant instrumental to put forth an impassioned five-minute plea, both showing and telling why he\\'s hip-hop\\'s G.O.A.T. He does a convincing job.\\n\\n57. \"Imaginary Player,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): It\\'s astounding how relevant this song is two decades after its release, in an era when social media is a tool for many to favorably skew the degree of their life\\'s awesomeness. Back in \\'97, Jay called folks out for faking it \\'til they make it, with a dismissive tone, collected flow, and receipts for his own boasts.\\n\\n56. \"Excuse Me Miss,\" The Blueprint\\xb2: The Gift & the Curse (2002): With \"Excuse Me Miss,\" Jay-Z made pursuing a woman sound easy. All you need are your own lucrative sneaker and liquor business deals, some housekeepers, and not one but two dishwashers and she\\'ll fall right into your arms. Hov combined The Neptunes\\' airy synths with inspiration from Luther Vandross\\'s \"Take You Out\" to make a courtship soundtrack that convinced an entire hip-hop generation that most of us can\\'t keep big pimpin\\' forever (even Jay). The song introduced a romantic opening phrase into the pop lexicon (then-teenager Chris Brown dropped his own \"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\" three years later). The fact that this song is definitely probably a reenactment of how Jay wooed Beyonc\\xe9 doesn\\'t hurt, either.\\n\\n55. \"Lucky Me,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Jay lets his guard down for a moment to lament the trappings of celebrity: jealousy, envy, deceit. His awareness of how quickly a bad decision could derail his career -- or inhibit his freedom -- is acute, especially for an artist so new to the spotlight (who\\'d be threatened with heavy jail time for stabbing Lance Rivera two years later). It\\'s a vulnerable, insightful look inside the mind of a young Shawn Carter.\\n\\n54. \"44 Fours (Live From Radio City Music Hall)\" (2006):\\n\\nJay doubled down on Reasonable Doubt\\'s number-based lyrical exercise \"22 Two\\'s\" -- on which he raps phonetic variations of \"two,\" 22 times -- for the album\\'s tenth anniversary. Here he tackles \"four\" (and \"for,\" etc.) 44 times, and while the track lacks the novelty and fully formed song execution of the original, Jay\\'s, um, four-play is just as proficient.\\n\\n53. \"Roc Boys (and the Winner Is ...),\" American Gangster (2007):\\n\\nA jubilant anthem, perfect for toasting to advancement, comradery, or prosperity, and then getting wasted at the bar with friends.\\n\\n52. \"Is That Yo Bitch,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): It\\'s impossible to listen to this song without imagining it as a reference to Jay\\'s dalliance with Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas\\'s first child. Especially considering Hov\\'s recount of his backseat encounters with Carmen on the below-the-belt diss \"Super Ugly.\" But subliminal or not, his shameless perspective on being a side dude thankfully produced this catchy gem that only existed on international releases of Vol. 3 before Memphis Bleek revamped it for his own sophomore album.\\n\\n51. \"In My Lifetime (Remix),\" Streets Is Watching Soundtrack (1998): I\\'m breaking this list\\'s no-remix stipulation because of this song\\'s significance to the Jay-Z canon. Whereas the original is sonically rougher around the edges, this Jaz-O-helmed revamp, with its pretty chimes and Soul II Soul sample, feels musically polished. Jay tells a story of a young hustler\\'s rise to the top of the drug game -- ironically, it feels like a foreshadowing of his future in music. \"I found a new route, you \\'bout to see my life change,\" Jay rhymes. Boy, was he right.\\n\\n50. \"H*A*M,\" Watch the Throne (2011):\\n\\nNo one quite anticipated that the first release from Watch the Throne would be helmed by the newbie producer who had been creating trunk-rattlers for Rick Ross and Waka Flocka Flame. But indeed it was Lex Luger who served up luxuriance with an audacious, aggressive beat, bizarrely juxtaposed by a shrill opera segment (clearly Kanye\\'s idea). If the Throne set out to make a statement, well, mission accomplished.\\n\\n49. \"Lost One,\" Kingdom Come (2006): A song about various types of loss that finds Jay-Z heartbroken as he dwells on the death of his nephew, Colleek. The 18-year-old was killed in a car accident while driving the Chrysler 300 that Jay bought him. But he finds solace in the fact that his nephew -- who Jay has periodically rapped about over the course of his career -- was expecting a child. \"Even the greatest loss holds the possibility of redemption,\" Jay wrote in Decoded. The same track finds Hov tackling his fallout with Damon Dash and addressing a seemingly failed relationship, supposedly with actress Rosario Dawson.\\n\\n48. \"So Ghetto,\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): Fresh off of the quintuple-platinum success of his best-selling album, Vol. 2, Jay-Z insists that his newfound superstardom hadn\\'t gone to his head.\\n\\nEverything about this track is unapologetically gutter, from a DJ Premier guitar sample that\\'s both grating and delicate, to Hov\\'s brash lyrics (The line \"We tote guns to the Grammys, pop bottles on the White House lawn\" very likely influenced Kendrick Lamar\\'s brazen To Pimp a Butterfly album cover, 15 years later.)\\n\\n47. \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" The Black Album (2003):\\n\\nThis is like Jay-Z\\'s play on OutKast\\'s \"So Fresh, So Clean,\" continuing to push the envelope thanks to an eccentric Timbaland production. Barack Obama alluded to this song during his 2008 presidential run, brushing off then-rival Hillary Clinton\\'s attacks, solidifying his connection to hip-hop, and immortalizing a Hov classic.\\n\\n46. \"Part II (on the Run),\" Magna Carta ... Holy Grail (2013): The latest episode in Jay-Z and Beyonc\\xe9\\'s Bonnie and Clyde saga (11 years after the original!) is endearing, like the musical equivalent of renewing wedding vows.\\n\\n45. \"You Must Love Me,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): Early in his career, Jay was best known for flaunting the spoils of his lucrative drug-dealing past. But this emotional number evinces underlying shame -- dwelling on the distress he inflicted upon his mother and the actual bullets he inserted into his brother\\'s body. It was the first time Jay-Z truly opened up his closet for the world to see his skeletons.\\n\\n44. \"Change Clothes,\" The Black Album (2003):\\n\\nPuff Daddy suggested an evolved stage of personal development every time he switched up his aliases; Jay-Z accomplished the same by buying a new wardrobe and then rapping about it. Before the age insecurities of Kingdom Come set in, Jay was proud to mature his sound and image (and push now-clich\\xe9d phrases like \"grown and sexy\"). He gets a nudge here from the Neptunes\\' sophisticated piano-based instrumental.\\n\\n43. \"Song Cry,\" The Blueprint (2001): One year after famously rapping \"have an affair, act like an adult for once,\" Jay-Z shares a cautionary tale describing the fallout of that playboy lifestyle. It\\'s not as emotional as the title suggests, but you can hear the remorse in his voice, albeit only slightly, as he reconciles with how his immaturity and selfishness ended a happy relationship and forever corrupted a \"good girl.\"\\n\\n42. \"Politics As Usual,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): Flashy rhymes and mafioso imagery laid over a glittery Stylistics sample -- it\\'s all a day in the life of Jay-Z.\\n\\n41. \"Allure,\" The Black Album (2003): There\\'s so much sincerity in this song about the irony of the hustler\\'s plight -- the idea of becoming addicted to the illegality of selling drugs. Even as one of hip-hop\\'s richest figures, Jay couldn\\'t shake the craving for that adrenaline rush, despite knowing and imagining the very real risks in detail. He\\'s almost longing for one more moment in the trap house, over the Neptunes\\' yearning piano keys and synthesizer. If The Black Album is a tentative good-bye to music, then \"Allure\" is Jay\\'s reluctant sayonara to the drug game that made him.\\n\\n40. \"Jigga My Nigga,\" Ruff Ryders\\'s Ryde or Die Vol. 1 (1999): Just as Jay-Z was becoming a superstar, Swizz Beatz turned his name into a jingle. The Ruff Ryders producer had Eve and Amil sing Jay\\'s moniker on this song\\'s hook, further implanting it into the minds of listeners and keeping his hot streak sizzling, even as Hov rapped with an unshakeable cool.\\n\\n39. \"Renegade,\" The Blueprint (2001): Lyrically, this is one of the best bar-for-bar collaborations in Jay-Z\\'s discography. He and Eminem play on the concept of being America\\'s nightmares, punching bags for the critics and naysayers who\\'ve never walked in their Nike Airs. Slim Shady edges Jay out with his twisted rhyme flow and religious imagery, but the lyrical square-off is much less lopsided than Nas\\'s \"Ether\" suggests (\"Renegade\" started as a collaboration between Royce da 5\\'9\" and Eminem, who made the beat, so Jay didn\\'t really have home-court advantage, either.)\\n\\n38. \"New Day,\" Watch the Throne (2011): Not only just a song anticipating fatherhood, \"New Day\" is a reflection on Kanye and Jay\\'s own lives -- respective plans to shield their future sons from the pain and regrets that they\\'ve experienced. The distorted Nina Simone sample adds a mystical feel.\\n\\n37. \"Encore,\" The Black Album (2003): \"Encore\" plays perfectly into The Black Album\\'s retirement campaign -- it\\'s a not-so-subtle comparison between his supposedly concluding career and the closing stages of a live performance. Contrived as it was, the analogy is ingenious. Not only is the song perfect for live shows, it also accomplishes the crafty trick of grieving Jay-Z while he\\'s still alive, with its weeping trumpet. Fans bought into it, despite several lyrical hints that suggest he\\'ll never stray too far away from the recording booth.\\n\\n36. \"Friend or Foe,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): The rare prequel that\\'s bested by its final chapter, \"Friend or Foe\" is all about Jay\\'s aplomb. There\\'s no bluster here, just menacing, smoothly delivered demands laid over Preem\\'s chilly horns.\\n\\n35. \"Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up),\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999): This irresistible toast to a recurring party life is the song you\\'d want playing when you enter the club with your closest compadres in tow. Beanie Sigel drops one of his finest verses, portraying the dangerous nightclub junction where both bottles and guns might pop.\\n\\n34. \"Coming of Age,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): Jay-Z came into the rap game as a made man -- a point underscored by his role in this story that doubles as the world\\'s introduction to Memphis Bleek. The song -- completely penned by Jay -- positions Hov as an OG seeking a hustler apprentice. It\\'s a masterful recruitment that presents the eager Bleek and streetwise Jay effectively.\\n\\n33. \"Murder to Excellence,\" Watch the Throne (2011): The most powerful moment on Watch the Throne -- and the thematic crux of the entire album -- finds two of hip-hop\\'s most important voices going for five minutes about police brutality, black unity, crashing through glass ceilings, and why the best revenge is your paper.\\n\\n32. \"22 Two\\'s,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): More than just a cheap party trick, this Ski-produced track exhibited Jay\\'s advanced wordplay and showman abilities from his very first album.\\n\\n31. \"Moment of Clarity,\" The Black Album (2003): Jay-Z offers a front-pew seat at his father\\'s funeral. His honesty is touching -- how are you supposed to react to the loss of someone you barely knew, whose DNA comprises half of your own? It\\'s an emotional boggler that Jay articulates deftly: \"Pretending to be hurt wouldn\\'t work / So a smirk was all on my face / Like, \\'Damn, that man\\'s face is just like my face.\\'\"\\n\\n30. \"Friend or Foe \\'98,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): DJ Premier\\'s instrumental is harder and more dramatic than that of Reasonable Doubt\\'s origin story, in which Jay-Z intercepts a rival hustler who\\'s encroaching on his territory. Jay\\'s delivery on this climactic sequel is equally aggravated, but he stays in character -- super cool, even letting off a few wisecracks before sending the poor guy to meet his maker with a couple of ice cubes and a friendly shoutout to Biggie.\\n\\n29. \"This Can\\'t Be Life,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): An essential track in establishing Roc-A-Fella\\'s signature sped-up sample aesthetic. Kanye\\'s flip of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes\\' classic \"I Miss You\" is tender and wistful, the perfect backdrop for Beanie, Jay, and Scarface to get personal about their pasts, presents, and futures.\\n\\n28. \"Where Have You Been,\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000): This is perhaps the most emotive on-wax scolding of deadbeat dads in existence. You can just hear the vulnerability. Beanie Sigel is audibly in tears. At times, Jay-Z raps through clenched teeth. A harrowing Camilo Sesto sample sets the mood as the two rappers unload years of hurt, using their platform to chew out absentee fathers.\\n\\n27. \"Ain\\'t No Nigga,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): This update of the Four Tops\\' \"Ain\\'t No Woman\" put Hov on the map, helping him land his deal with Def Jam and a coveted slot on the Nutty Professor soundtrack. Jay and an amped Foxy Brown -- then still a teenage rapper on the rise -- throw playful negs at each other throughout, beginning a musical harmony that\\'d last for years.\\n\\n26. \"Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99),\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): A welcome return to Jay-Z\\'s rapid-fire flow, finding a home over Timbaland\\'s thumping bass line and crisp snares. It\\'s a developed evolution, a tempering of his double-time delivery that\\'s easier to keep up with than past speed raps, yet still dazzling to both day-one fans and newcomers to the bandwagon.\\n\\n25. \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.),\" The Blueprint (2001): Besides helping to push the Snoop Dogg-popularized \"-izzle\" slang to caricature, this lead single from The Blueprint gave a Jackson 5 sample new life and Jay-Z his first top-ten Billboard Hot 100 appearance.\\n\\n24. \"Otis,\" Watch the Throne (2011):\\n\\nThe quintessential Jay and Kanye collaboration. The two emcees take turns making claims that might sound ridiculous being spat by anyone else, upping the ante with every line. Jay has two Rolex watches; Kanye has three Benzes. Yeezy hints at birthing Drake\\'s style; Jigga insinuates that he predates an entire \"swag rap\" subgenre. Hov can buy political asylum; Kanye is protected from eternal damnation. All of this boasting takes place over a sputtering Teddy Pendergrass sample that\\'s a welcome progression from Kanye\\'s early soul loops.\\n\\n23. \"Lucifer,\" The Black Album (2003): Kanye\\'s sample of Max Romeo\\'s \"Chase the Devil\" establishes a spiritual element in a song about retribution, as Jay-Z lashes out against the unknown (or inaccessible) killers of his friends.\\n\\n22. \"Regrets,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): Reasonable Doubt is an album that presents Jay-Z\\'s experiences as an avatar for hustlers who\\'ve run the same Brooklyn streets as him. Here, he gets a bit more personal, using tension brilliantly throughout. In one verse, Jay has a conversation with a deceased friend; in another, he recalls coming this close to being busted in a sting operation. Overall, the song is about morality and facing the guilt that comes with participating in the dark world that Jay depicts on his debut -- it\\'s not unlike the shame of an addict coming off of a high, knowing they can\\'t escape the substance that\\'s most destructive to them.\\n\\n\"Regrets\" is a sobering album outro that furthers the complex, conflicted persona that is Shawn Carter.\\n\\n21. \"Money, Cash, Hoes,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): As urban legend has it, an epic battle between Jay-Z and DMX went down in the early \\'90s at a pool hall in the Bronx. Things reportedly got tense; the winner of the face-off varies based on who you ask. The two emcees would appear on tracks in the years that followed, but \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" was the perfect storm. By then, X was New York\\'s grittiest emcee, coming off of a massively successful debut LP. Jay was all about flossing, but had the ear of the streets as well. They collided here over a genius Swizz Beatz track, which samples \"Theme of Thief,\" music that appears in the 1989 video game Golden Axe. The result: A hard-knock anthem that set the stage for two once-in-a-generation rappers to rule hip-hop for years to come.\\n\\n20. \"Run This Town,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009): This song started out as a Rihanna demo and went on to become a grand opening for Roc Nation and one of the most successful singles of Jay\\'s solo career. His two greatest musical prot\\xe9g\\xe9s shine: Rih\\'s vocals are perfect, like a war cry with a touch of rasp, and Kanye, who\\'s claimed he spent a month writing his verse, aggressively expresses his love-hate relationship with stardom (and drops a memorable RAV4 un-endorsement). As for Jay, he births the oft-quoted phrase \"all-black everything\" here.\\n\\n19. \"Streets Is Watching,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): The opening line, \"If I shoot you, I\\'m brainless / But if you shoot me, you\\'re famous,\" is perhaps the truest assessment of the conundrum facing former outlaws in the public eye. This standout from Vol. 1 is like a savvy manual on how to rise from a life of crime without blowing it once you make it big. The final verse colorfully runs down Jay\\'s criminal capers over Ski\\'s epic string sample.\\n\\n18. \"Feelin\\' It,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): The skeleton of this song originally belonged to NYC rhyme duo Camp Lo, who gifted it to Jay when they realized it didn\\'t fit the sound of their own debut album. Jigga took that sung hook and gorgeous piano loop -- courtesy of Ski -- and transformed them into a melodic single that added a fleck of R&B soulfulness to a classic album that\\'s heavy on intricate raps.\\n\\n17. \"U Don\\'t Know,\" The Blueprint (2001): One of Jay-Z\\'s most high-powered anthems gets its oomph from a Bobby Byrd sample that Just Blaze distorted and pitched up beyond recognition. The awesome instrumental is the product of a friendly in-studio beat battle with Kanye West. While Just Blaze wasn\\'t satisfied with the final beat (hence the upgraded M.O.P.-featured remix on The Blueprint\\xb2), it was a fitting soundtrack for Jay-Z to count his millions and boast about his hustler forte.\\n\\n16. \"Can\\'t Knock the Hustle,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996): This mid-tempo track is an appropriate introduction to Reasonable Doubt -- it\\'s Jay\\'s formal musical announcement to his buddies on the block that his hustling days are over and hip-hop is the new moneymaker. But the hit single, which nicely renovates Meli\\'sa Morgan\\'s 1986 track \"Fool\\'s Paradise,\" almost didn\\'t happen. According to Damon Dash, Jay was hesitant to rap over the beat. But it all came together once they got the hottest singer in hip-hop and R&B, Mary J. Blige, to bless the track with her vocals as a personal favor -- Dash says they paid her $10,000 in a brown paper bag, just pennies compared to the greenbacks Jay flaunts in this song\\'s stanzas.\\n\\n15. \"Can I Get A ...,\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998): Jay-Z cashed in on the insecurities of moneyed men with this megahit that shuns gold-digging women. He made it a true battle of the sexes by inviting Roc-A-Fella\\'s newest artist Amil, penning an assertive verse for her to counter his own. Her voice adds a distinctive touch; light like whip cream with a dollop of sass: \"You ain\\'t gotta be rich but fuck that / How we gonna get around on your bus pass?\" she asks, just months before TLC dropped \"No Scrubs.\" But \"Can I Get A ...\" all started in the mind of Ja Rule, then an up-and-coming Queens rapper who wrote the hook and gave the song to Jay in exchange for a feature slot. The three artists made history by pondering what matters most: the size of a man\\'s heart or his bankroll. All these years later, the question is still up for debate.\\n\\n14. \"99 Problems,\" The Black Album (2003):\\n\\nJay-Z was inspired by Ice-T\\'s 1993 song of the same name -- according to Rick Rubin, it was Chris Rock\\'s suggestion. But Jay made the concept his own, using Rubin\\'s raucous electric guitars as an ambience to slam music media and call out prejudiced cops, complete with a mocking southern accent.\\n\\n13. \"Where I\\'m From,\" In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997): A walk around the perimeters of Jay-Z\\'s hood that offers a high-definition look at Marcy Projects in all of its beauty and horror. Both the lyrics and monstrous bass line will shake you to your core, as Jay portrays the lives of shooters, pimps, prostitutes, hustlers, ballers, rappers, and trigger-happy police officers -- a far cry from the gentrified Brooklyn blocks that exist in the area present day.\\n\\n12. \"Takeover,\" The Blueprint (2001): Many believed \"Takeover\" to be a knockout blow before Nas retaliated with his own haymaker, \"Ether.\" But musically, this is bigger than just a battle song. Kanye West chopped up a crazy sample from the Doors -- taming the unruly guitar strings -- and got the hell out of the way. Jay presents a slideshow of his adversaries\\' shortcomings and missteps, humiliating Mobb Deep and portraying Nas as a fraudulent hip-hop has-been; the addition of David Bowie\\'s altered faaame sound bite is a shrewd touch as well. The gloves are off, and Jay taught a new generation how to pick apart an enemy.\\n\\n11. \"Niggas in Paris,\" Watch the Throne (2011):\\n\\nOkay, no, this is the quintessential Jay and Kanye collaboration. The title in itself is radical, a dissonance inspired by attending the most exclusive Parisian fashion shows while listening to Young Jeezy. Quotables abound, especially from Kanye (\"What she order? Fish filet\"), but Jay reminds you that more than extravagance, this song is a celebration of life itself -- statistics say the two artists were exponentially more likely to be dead or in jail than mingling in the upper echelon of fortune and fame. Hit-Boy instantly became a go-to producer after lacing these hypnotic synths that give way to explosive drums.\\n\\n10. \"D\\'Evils,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996):\\n\\nThis is the darkest moment on an album full of green-splattered fantasy and criminal atrocity. Over a solemn DJ Premier instrumental, Jay-Z depicts the evil that can possess those who live in poverty, creating monsters who are driven by greed and a craving for power. Jay says he dreamt the first bars of this song, but verse two is more like a nightmare: He imagines a tale of treachery in which he turns on a childhood friend, kidnapping and bribing the mother of his child, and implying their impending demises. As a wordsmith, it\\'s Jay at his most macabre.\\n\\n9. \"Dead Presidents\" / \"Dead Presidents II,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996):\\n\\nTake a listen to the original Lonnie Liston Smith piano loop sampled for this standout chapter in the Jay-Z canon; it\\'s cold and beautiful -- the sound of loneliness. Ski sped up that melody, threw some drums beneath, and a classic Nas vocal chop on top to create the soundscape for Jay to revel in the highs and lows of hustling. Both versions feature the same beat -- the sequel is merely a means to update the superior original -- and a total of five thoughtful verses from Jay that still stand as some of his most cunning lyricism.\\n\\n8. \"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me),\" The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000):\\n\\nThe sentiment of this timeless smash hit came from a party thrown by Kimora Lee Simmons. Jay remembered seeing Mary J. Blige dancing to Carl Thomas\\'s \"I Wish,\" which Jay karaokes with some of his best bad singing. The track is a magical combination of Jay-Z\\'s feel-good rhymes and the Neptunes\\' funky bass lines, which helped make the Virginia music men household names.\\n\\n7. \"Public Service Announcement (Interlude),\" The Black Album (2003):\\n\\nThis is a dynamite stick in Jay-Z\\'s live set. At the last minute of The Black Album\\'s recording, Just Blaze lifted an explosive riff from Little Boy Blues\\' \"Seed of Love\" -- suspenseful piano chords that give way to a jolting organ. Jay took that dramatic melody and ran with it. His first verse is all spelled-out flows, declarative bravado, and sneaky puns. The second is largely inspired by journalist Elizabeth M\\xe9ndez Berry, who attended a preliminary album playback for media. She questioned the contradiction of Jay wearing a diamond necklace over a T-shirt depicting Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, before handing him an acerbic critical essay that she wrote about his past music. And hence, Hov spits \"I\\'m like Che Guevara with bling on, I\\'m complex\" to open a stanza that\\'s introspective and almost defensive when explaining how his past shaped his current objectives. Ultimately, the track is a Jay-Z mission statement that also happens to be one of the most memorable songs of his career.\\n\\n6. \"Brooklyn\\'s Finest,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996):\\n\\nThis classic back-and-forth lyrical slugfest between two of the absolute best to ever do it started as a solo cut called \"No More Mr. Nice Guy.\" Once the Notorious B.I.G. was onboard, Jay altered his verses so he could trade friendly fire with the reigning king of N.Y., and changed the title to something more precise. You can hear each verse upping the ante for the next. \"From \\'9-6, the only MC with a flu / Yeah I rhyme sick, I be what you\\'re trying to do,\" Jay challenges, only for Biggie to counter with his own sick punch line, \"Gotta go, Coolio mean it\\'s getting \\'Too Hot\\' / If Fay\\' had twins, she\\'d probably have two \\'Pacs.\" Decision is split on whose performance is toughest (I\\'d take Big by a whisker), but the song is one of the most intense and enjoyable rap duets Jay ever recorded.\\n\\n5. \"4:44,\" 4:44 (2017):\\n\\nThis is what a sincere version of \"Song Cry\" might sound like. A track that doesn\\'t make light of matters of the heart with flippant rationale like, \"I was just fuckin\\' those girls, I was gon\\' get right back.\" No, this one is full of genuine remorse. Real heartache. Jay-Z airs out his indiscretions over a tortured sample of Hannah Williams & the Affirmations\\' \"Late Nights & Heartbreak,\" issuing an open apology to Beyonc\\xe9 for missing the mark as a husband in more ways than one. \"I never wanted another woman to know / Something about me that you didn\\'t know,\" he rhymes, shamefaced. He sounds at his most repentant when wondering if his children will one day see him differently after learning of his mistakes. \"4:44\" raises Jay-Z\\'s bar for emotive music, once again proving that the best music often arises from places of pain.\\n\\n4. \"Empire State of Mind,\" The Blueprint 3 (2009):\\n\\nPrototypical NYC anthems like Billy Joel\\'s \"New York State of Mind\" or Frank Sinatra\\'s \"Theme From New York, New York\" tend to be sugarcoated, pandering to the ideals of tourists who\\'ve never stepped foot in the Big Apple. Jay keeps those archetypes in his Alicia Keys-guested \"Empire State of Mind\" -- shouting out the city\\'s yellow cabs and major sports teams -- but adds a heavy dose of realism, also showing its perilous underbelly. The result makes for an interesting juxtaposition between Keys\\'s celebratory vocals and Hov\\'s lyrics about prostitution. Grand and gritty, a proper hip-hop ode to Gotham City.\\n\\n3. \"Big Pimpin,\\'\" Vol. 3 ... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999):\\n\\nTimbaland\\'s flute sample in \"Big Pimpin\\'\" has the power to instantly teleport you to somewhere much hotter and more tropical than your current location. For Jay, it helped relocate him to a high slot on the pop charts, and granted Texas duo UGK -- who arguably upstage Hov here -- the most successful song of its career. Bun B\\'s unorthodox flow sounds right at home, but Pimp C\\'s bouncy, fun verse has aged best. The opposite can be said for Jay\\'s savage, misogynistic rhymes. \"What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?\" he wrote in Decoded years later. Still, \"Big Pimpin\\'\" was an important moment in cementing Jay\\'s status as a reliable hit-maker, and helping to eliminate hip-hop\\'s already-shrinking regional divide.\\n\\n2. \"Can I Live,\" Reasonable Doubt (1996):\\n\\nThis is all sonic dramatics and verbal acrobatics. The beat, built on a sample of Isaac Hayes\\'s \"The Look of Love,\" feels like a scene in a gangster flick -- producer Irv Gotti was inspired by the film Dead Presidents. On the track, Jay evokes paranoia and affluence and introspection via multisyllabic flows that offer a deeper psychological analysis of the mind of a hustler. It\\'s lyrically one of Jay\\'s best showcases, a perfect example of why Jay-Z is one of the best rappers of all time.\\n\\n1. \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),\" Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life (1998):\\n\\nBroken down in the simplest form, Jay-Z\\'s career exists in two acts: before and after this song\\'s existence. \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\" changed the course of Jay-Z\\'s career and made his life and times understandable (and captivating) to millions. Mark the 45 King\\'s Annie sample is the not-so-secret sauce on this whopper of a hit record -- vocals of the orphaned characters portray a beautiful struggle that\\'s both the furthest thing from hip-hop and its epitome. Jay\\'s street-conscious lyricism oozes authenticity and bridges the gap, making this song a crown jewel in his discography.', u'title': u'All 274 Jay-Z Songs, Ranked From Worst to Best', u'url': u'http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/all-274-jay-z-songs-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html', u'uri': u'720757589', u'eventUri': u'eng-3412300', u'dateTime': u'2017-09-05T15:00:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-05', u'source': {u'title': u'Vulture', u'id': u'1206', u'uri': u'vulture.com'}, u'time': u'15:00:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 13, u'id': u'13206307', u'sim': 0.6000000238418579}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'QUAKELAND: On the Road to America\\'s Next Devastating Earthquake by Kathryn Miles looks into the threat of earthquakes to the infrastructure and people of the United States.\\n\\nThese days, Lusk spends most of his time in the Memphis-based FedEx Global Operations Control Center at a campus adjacent to the airport. It\\'s a room just shy of the Dr. Strangelove set and overwhelmingly dominated by a massive movie-\\u200b\\xadtheater-\\u200b\\xadsize screen (which is actually about forty 40\\u2011inch high-\\u200b\\xadtech monitors squished together in a grid). There, he and the Global Operations Control team can track every FedEx air asset in real time. They can keep tabs on weather conditions, congestion, and flight hours. Lusk explains it is in the nature of the business for things to go wrong.\\n\\nSometimes, it\\'s a simple mechanical failure or, in the case of tonight, a violent weather system. When Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, restricted airspace around the crash site changed flight patterns and added an extra twenty or thirty minutes to travel time -- a major headache when you\\'re managing over 650 planes and airports in every time zone.\\n\\nDisasters pose a particular problem for a company that needs to be in the air and on the ground no matter what. In the days after 9/11, Lusk had to figure out how to turn airfreight into a ground game. When Hurricane Matthew made landfall in South Carolina, closing airports and roads there, he worked through a FEMA clearing house to get reentry letters for his crews, who were carrying resources for the Red Cross, along with basic supplies.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t relish them, but Lusk says the nice thing about a lot of natural disasters is that they are polite enough to give advance warning. Lusk\\'s crew includes a staff of fifteen meteorologists who work in conjunction with the company\\'s logistical team. When Superstorm Sandy was bearing down on the Mid-\\u200b\\xadAtlantic, they rerouted fifty planes and stepped up operations in the heartland. When Katrina decimated the Gulf Coast, FedEx had to suspend operations in places like New Orleans and Biloxi. In the meantime, Lusk sent down members of the FedEx security team (who are also commissioned police officers) to account for each employee and hand out cash to those who needed it.\\n\\nSeismic events, he says, pose a particular hazard that\\'s challenging even for the leader in logistical management. \"Earthquakes are immediate and local. We can\\'t track them. We can\\'t predict them.\" So what\\'s going to happen to your medication and your contracts and your bullets and your radioactive waste if and when the big New Madrid quake goes off?\\n\\nLusk says you\\'re going to have to be patient -- at least at first. His first mission is going to be to make sure all of his employees are safe and sound. He\\'s stashed days\\' supplies of water and MREs in shipping containers around the FedEx campus, and the facility\\'s twenty diesel generators can keep operations running for about twenty-\\u200b\\xadfour hours on a tank of gas. But until he knows his employees have been safely evacuated, your package is going to have to wait.\\n\\nBack in the 1990s, when the New Madrid fault zone was getting a lot of attention, Lusk asked engineering and seismic scholars from around the region to assess the FedEx facility. On their advice, they\\'ve retrofitted the buildings here. He feels pretty sure they\\'ll still be standing, even in a major quake. What he really worries about is fire.\\n\\n\"The fire department isn\\'t going to be here in five minutes. They\\'re going to be digging their equipment out of the rubble,\" predicts Lusk.\\n\\nTo be safe, FedEx has established a \"hot\" contingency control center thirty miles east of the airport. \"Hot,\" Lusk explains, as in \"plug and play -- it\\'s a completely redundant facility.\" One day each week, his team runs the company\\'s operations from there, just to make sure everything is in working order. Twice a year, they move operations over there for two full weeks.\\n\\n\"We want to really stress that facility,\" he says. \"If we have to deploy there in an emergency, we want to know we\\'ve done it before. If you\\'ve gone through it again and again, then things start to feel pretty much rote.\"\\n\\nThe company also maintains a duplicate data center in Colorado in case of this kind of disaster -- part of what Lusk calls \"risk mitigation by mitigating risk over geography.\"\\n\\nWhile that switch is happening, Lusk\\'s other major concern will be to get his aircraft out of Memphis. That\\'ll have to wait until the runways have been inspected and tower controls are fully functional.

There was live music seven days a week, a restaurant and a \"build your own Bloody Mary\" station for Sunday brunch.\\n\\nBut Hurricane Irma ended all of that at Snappers Key Largo, a landmark of the Florida Keys bohemian lifestyle.\\n\\nNo one knows when the waterfront bar and restaurant will open again. The owners already are hard at work to rebuild, but it was one of the hardest hit structures in the Upper Keys.\\n\\nFor more coverage of Hurricane Irma and the storm\\'s aftermath visit: news-press.com/hurricane.\\n\\nThe Keys are more than just turquoise water landscapes. Funky mom-and-pop shops, kayak businesses, waterside charter operations, restaurants and bars make the chain of islands a refuge from the typical daily grind for tourists. Establishments like Snappers are meetup spots for the renegades and rebels who made the so-called \"Conch Republic\" their permanent home.\\n\\nMore: Hurricane Irma expected to batter, boost Florida\\'s economy\\n\\nMany described Snappers and the Keys as their \"Cheers,\" in reference to the 1980s TV show known as the place \"where everybody knows your name.\"\\n\\nThe Keys without such businesses \"wouldn\\'t be the Keys,\" Snappers customer Israel Debilzan said. The carpenter used to come to Snappers almost every day and liked to start off with Coors Light and end with Stella Artois beers.\\n\\n\"This place made the Upper Keys,\" Debilzan said.\\n\\nOwner Peter Althois said he will rebuild Snappers in sections and hopes to reopen with a temporary outdoor bar and food truck as soon as possible. He said he has no idea how much a full rebuild and recovery will cost him.\\n\\nAll the kitchen equipment is gone: coolers for seafood, perishable items and beer; prep stations; fryers; oven; refrigerators. The inside floors and ceiling need replacing; an outdoor bar has been obliterated. Plastic chairs strewn around the property are mostly what\\'s left.\\n\\nMore: Hurricane Irma: How NBC-2 meteorologist Robert Van Winkle tracked storm with precision\\n\\n\"In San Francisco you have earthquakes... you have 9/11 in New York,\" Althois said. \"What am I supposed to do? You have to deal with it. The only lesson is you have to make construction stronger.\"\\n\\nRebuild it stronger\\n\\nThe Keys are lucky hurricane season runs mostly during the slow tourist season from June 1 to Nov. 30, Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers said. That gives businesses time to rebuild before tourists begin to flock here around Thanksgiving.\\n\\nCarruthers, a former inn owner, said she worries Irma will alter the character and uniqueness of the Keys. But she\\'s optimistic businesses will use relief dollars to improve their operations and do repairs they previously couldn\\'t afford. She expects Fantasy Fest, Key West\\'s famous street party, to still take place from Oct. 20 to 29.\\n\\nMore: Hurricane Irma update: Farmers assessing damage; U.S. Sugar reporting at least $20 million loss\\n\\nMonroe County, where the Keys are located, is among the 21 Florida counties where businesses can apply for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration to recover from Irma. They may qualify for up to $2 million for physical damage and economic injury if owners have a good credit history, and can show an ability to repay.\\n\\n\"I tend to be an optimist that this might give people an opportunity to sort of improve their product,\" Carruthers said.\\n\\nNot leaving\\n\\nCarruthers described the Keys as a place where \"you come from someplace else and it either embraces you... or spits you out.\"\\n\\nThose who are here are here to stay regardless of Irma\\'s destruction. They are anxiously waiting the all-clear from authorities to return to parts of the Lower Keys, she said.\\n\\nSome businesses that didn\\'t sustain much damage already were open. Mrs. Mac\\'s Kitchen in Key Largo was one of the first businesses to reopen after the devastating Hurricane Andrew in 1992, co-owner Paula Wittke said. And it was one of the first ones open again after Irma, serving \"Hurricane Irma Menu\" that included chili hot dogs with cottage fries and slaw, and Caribbean steak tacos with black beans and rice.\\n\\nReopening as quickly as possible is about returning to normalcy and giving locals a place to vent about Irma, Wittke said. Tourists normally make up half of her clientele so she expects the following months to be tough for all local businesses.\\n\\n\"We know that\\'s going to be a long time until it gets back to normal,\" she said.\\n\\n\"We are really attached to this place\"\\n\\nSome Keys entrepreneurs were so afraid to leave their shops and restaurants they ignored an evacuation order in place before Irma made landfall in the Lower Keys Sunday morning.\\n\\nSkip in Skipx\\n\\nEmbed\\n\\nx\\n\\nShare\\n\\nCLOSE\\n\\nToday on the News in 90 seconds, we\\'re looking at some trapped manatees, a lightening of Cocoa\\'s boil water notice and a lucky ticket winning the Fantasy 5 drawing.

He\\'s been staying in Miami.\\n\\nHernandez found a picture of the wreckage posted on Facebook, and although Lower Keys residents were not allowed to return home this week, he sneaked through a checkpoint with help from a friend.

He and his wife, Camille, loaded up their Honda Accord last Friday with everything precious in their lives. Their son Seth and daughter Arabel squeezed into the small car, joined by a pit bull named Blitz, two kittens - Willow and Autumn - and a guinea pig called Elliott.\\n\\nLike Noah, in a tiny way, they found safety on their ark. They put whatever possessions they could fit into every nook and cranny of the Accord, and then they drove 15 hours from their home in Tarpon Springs, on Florida\\'s Gulf Coast, to a hotel in Slidell, La.\\n\\nThe traffic was crushing, with countless anxious nomads inching in the same direction. It was a drive that should have taken maybe nine hours, at most.\\n\\nRoss and Camille, a graduate student in computer engineering, feared their family would be in the direct path of Hurricane Irma.\\n\\nBy Tuesday, they felt safe enough to describe themselves as fortunate. From what they\\'d heard in calls from home, they believed their home endured little damage.\\n\\nThe hurricane didn\\'t hit his neighborhood with the kind of force that many forecasters expected, Ross said. He works as a mover, and the five days away cost him both his regular paycheck and about $1,000 in savings to feed and house his family on the road.\\n\\nWith the benefit of hindsight, they probably could have stayed home and rode it out, Ross said. But he saw the result for many who made that decision when Hurricane Harvey pounded Houston. People died. Digging in would have put his wife and kids at risk.\\n\\n\"All I could think about last week was what would happen if we decided to stay, and my family ended up on the roof, shouting for help,\" he said, during a stop at a Shell service station in Daphne, Ala., near the Florida border.\\n\\nThey had decided on Tuesday it was time to go home. They made the slow, hot and sweaty drive toward Florida on crowded Interstate 10, a kind of 21st century Steinbeck scene. Returning families with possessions and big jugs of gas strapped to their cars fell in line behind rumbling trucks and heavy equipment bringing disaster relief.\\n\\nRoss Hayes took it in stride. One of the kittens snoozed on his shoulder as he drove. Blitz - a peaceful dog they found in the woods long ago, abandoned and starving - watched the world from the back seat, seemingly unperturbed by all the chaos.\\n\\nBut the power was still out near their home. Ross and Camille Hayes knew they might not be able to get gas for a long time.\\n\\nThe little family joined hundreds - if not thousands - of other refugees, on their way back to Florida, who stopped at the Shell station throughout the day.\\n\\nThey saw it as potentially a last chance opportunity. They filled up on gasoline, squeezing in every last drop, in case the power remained out and gas was impossible to find near their homes.\\n\\nThose in line by the pumps offered many tales of weary relief. Luis and Viridiana Hernandez fled Clearwater last week with their children and Viridiana\\'s mother. They found refuge with relatives in Texas.\\n\\nStill in disbelief their misfortune wasn\\'t worse, they were on their way back Tuesday to a house that had suffered little damage.\\n\\nLuis went to a store to buy containers for extra gasoline. The gas buckets were all gone, claimed by people in similar need. He had to buy some oil change containers to use in a makeshift way for the same purpose.\\n\\nDeWyna Robinson evacuated her Jacksonville home to spend several days at a La Quinta hotel in Daphne, which was \"full of people praying for each other and doing kind things,\" she said.\\n\\nShe is a native of New Orleans. She said she lost an uncle in flooding after Hurricane Katrina, after he chose to stay home and tried to care for his dog. His death remains an open wound for the family. She started crying when she recalled the day her aunt learned with certainty that her uncle was dead.\\n\\nRobinson did not want to repeat his choice.\\n\\nIn the days and hours before Irma arrived, she listened to the dire warnings about the hurricane, and she thought about her uncle ....\\n\\nAnd she got out.\\n\\nIt was a wise move. Jacksonville was pounded by Irma. Robinson, an Air Force veteran, settled there following her enlistment. She built a career as a mental health therapist. She bought as much gasoline and bottled water as she could Tuesday and prepared herself for the journey home.\\n\\nAs soon as she\\'s back, she said, she intends to volunteer to help.\\n\\nThe Rev. Jason Hanks, who filled several jugs of gas at the pumps, said his family learned a hard lesson in what a flood can do, long before Irma. He is pastor of the Christian Center Church in Homosassa, Fla.\\n\\nHe knows how much a vehicle can matter when there is no power - not only for transportation, but for charging mobile phones to maintain contact with the world.\\n\\nWith that in mind, he bought as much gas as he could.\\n\\nBarely a year ago, Hanks, his wife, Leah, and their two children Hudson and Hollynd were living in Baton Rouge when the city was hit by torrential rains that caused flash flooding.\\n\\nWater poured into the Hanks home. They had maybe 15 minutes of warning. There was no time to save even their most beloved family photos.\\n\\n\"We lost everything,\" said Leah Hanks, who is also an ordained minister.\\n\\nAt the time, members of the Christian Center in Homosassa - a sister parish - offered them shelter. They stayed there for a while. They never forgot the kindness. Jason Hanks, who\\'d served as an associate pastor in Louisiana, was thrilled when he was eventually offered the chance to serve as pastor in Homosassa.\\n\\nIt seemed as if his family had barely settled in before the warnings came about Hurricane Irma, about potential flooding that made what happened in Baton Rouge seem small.\\n\\n\"This time, I knew to do what I should have done last time,\" said 11-year-old Hudson Hanks.\\n\\nHe had lost his most precious possessions in Baton Rouge.\\n\\nLast week, before his family left their home, he put the things he cared about the most in a safe, dry place in their house. His saxophone. His laptop. His guitar. His tennis shoes.\\n\\nHis little sister carefully did the same with her collection of hair bows.\\n\\nThere were projections that a storm surge of 6 to 12 feet might engulf their home, Leah Hanks said. After the flooding of a year ago, they had no reason to doubt it.\\n\\nThe Hanks family packed up and drove 600 miles to their old parish in Baton Rouge, where they were given shelter. They were joined by several other families from their community. Yet they learned, over the past few days, that their home was spared heavy damage.\\n\\nThey were on their way back Tuesday. They had no power yet at their house, but Jason worried about how elderly parishioners might be faring without air conditioning or transportation. He and Leah wanted to get started with clearing brush and debris.\\n\\nIn all ways, they wanted to check on their church.\\n\\n\"Bad things happen,\" Jason said.

It will be tough, but they are thankful for what was left. Andrea Melendez/news-press.com\\n\\nKEY LARGO -- This was the bar where they knew you by your drink. There was live music seven days a week, a restaurant and a \"build your own Bloody Mary\" station for Sunday brunch.\\n\\nBut Hurricane Irma ended all of that at Snappers Key Largo, a landmark of the Florida Keys bohemian lifestyle.\\n\\nNo one knows when the waterfront bar and restaurant will open again. The owners already are hard at work to rebuild, but it was one of the hardest hit structures in the Upper Keys.\\n\\nThe Keys are more than just turquoise water landscapes. Funky mom-and-pop shops, kayak businesses, waterside charter operations, restaurants and bars make the chain of islands a refuge from the typical daily grind for tourists. Establishments like Snappers are meetup spots for the renegades and rebels who made the so-called \"Conch Republic\" their permanent home.\\n\\nMany described Snappers and the Keys as their \"Cheers,\" in reference to the 1980s TV show known as the place \"where everybody knows your name.\"\\n\\nThe Keys without such businesses \"wouldn\\'t be the Keys,\" Snappers customer Israel Debilzan said. The carpenter used to come to Snappers almost every day and liked to start off with Cors Light and end with Stella Artois beers.\\n\\n\"This place made the Upper Keys,\" Debilzan said.\\n\\nOwner Peter Althois said he will rebuild Snappers in sections and hopes to reopen with a temporary outdoor bar and food truck as soon as possible. He said he has no idea how much a full rebuild and recovery will cost him.\\n\\nAll the kitchen equipment is gone: coolers for seafood, perishable items and beer; prep stations; fryers; oven; refrigerators. The inside floors and ceiling need replacing; an outdoor bar has been obliterated. Plastic chairs strewn around the property are mostly what\\'s left.\\n\\n\"In San Francisco you have earthquakes... you have 9/11 in New York,\" Althois said. \"What am I supposed to do? You have to deal with it. The only lesson is you have to make construction stronger.\"\\n\\nRebuild it stronger\\n\\nThe Keys are lucky hurricane season runs mostly during the slow tourist season from June 1 to Nov. 30, Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers said. That gives businesses time to rebuild before tourists begin to flock here around Thanksgiving.\\n\\nCarruthers, a former inn owner, said she worries Irma will alter the character and uniqueness of the Keys. But she\\'s optimistic businesses will use relief dollars to improve their operations and do repairs they previously couldn\\'t afford. She expects Fantasy Fest, Key West\\'s famous street party, to still take place from Oct. 20 to 29.\\n\\nMonroe County, where the Keys are located, is among the 21 Florida counties where businesses can apply for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration to recover from Irma. They may qualify for up to $2 million for physical damage and economic injury if owners have a good credit history, and can show an ability to repay.\\n\\n\"I tend to be an optimist that this might give people an opportunity to sort of improve their product,\" Carruthers said.\\n\\nNot leaving\\n\\nCarruthers described the Keys as a place where \"you come from someplace else and it either embraces you... or spits you out.\"\\n\\nThose who are here are here to stay regardless of Irma\\'s destruction. They are anxiously waiting the all-clear from authorities to return to parts of the Lower Keys, she said.\\n\\nSome businesses that didn\\'t sustain much damage already were open. Mrs. Mac\\'s Kitchen in Key Largo was one of the first businesses to reopen after the devastating Hurricane Andrew in 1992, co-owner Paula Wittke said. And it was one of the first ones open again after Irma, serving \"Hurricane Irma Menu\" that included chili hot dogs with cottage fries and slaw, and Caribbean steak tacos with black beans and rice.\\n\\nReopening as quickly as possible is about returning to normalcy and giving locals a place to vent about Irma, Wittke said. Tourists normally make up half of her clientele so she expects the following months to be tough for all local businesses.\\n\\n\"We know that\\'s going to be a long time until it gets back to normal,\" she said.\\n\\n\"We are really attached to this place\"\\n\\nSome Keys entrepreneurs were so afraid to leave their shops and restaurants they ignored an evacuation order in place before Irma made landfall in the Lower Keys Sunday morning.\\n\\nBob Rankin sheltered in the bathroom of his Marathon kayak shop with his Pitbull Sasha, a cooler, an air mattress and water for about 18 hours. He heard a layer of his roof coming off and the kayaks in the basement, pushed by storm surge, slamming against the floor.\\n\\nKeys Kayak lost about 20 kayaks, but Rankin hopes to reopen before Thanksgiving. He said he makes one-third of his annual revenue in the six weeks before Christmas.\\n\\nThe priority at Robbie\\'s in Islamorada is to rebuild the dock that made the business a destination for feeding the tarpon that frequent the northern-most end of Lower Matecumbe Key.\\n\\n\"We\\'re really attached to this place,\" said Cailin Reckwerdt, whose family built Robbie\\'s, a marina, restaurant, and shop complex. She stayed in Key Largo during the storm.\\n\\nIt will take the family at least one month to reopen a waterfront bar and Reckwerdt doesn\\'t know when the business will be fully operational again.\\n\\nRobbie\\'s, which opened in 1976, attracts 10,000 visitors a day during the high season, Reckwerdt said. It might be better off than other businesses as it has a savings account for hurricane repairs, Reckwerdt said.\\n\\n\"We know what we should expect,\" she said. \"We\\'re just ahead of the game.\"\\n\\nThe smallest of the small\\n\\nBut it\\'s the smallest of small businesses that stand to lose the most.\\n\\nCharter and commercial fisherman Alex Hernandez, 27, will resort to working in construction. His fishing equipment and boats -- a 28-footer and a 17-footer -- survived Irma, but he doesn\\'t think there will be enough fish or lobster for the next couple of months because of the storm.\\n\\nHernandez, who earned about $30,000 last year, expects to make less money because, he said, construction jobs pay only $90 to $120 per day. He lost the mobile home where he lived with his girlfriend in Long Key after authorities marked it with an \"X\" as inhabitable. He\\'s been staying in Miami.\\n\\nHernandez found a picture of the wreckage posted on Facebook, and although Lower Keys residents were not allowed to return home this week, he sneaked through a checkpoint with help from a friend. He paid $210,000 for the land and trailer and, like many mobile home residents here, doesn\\'t have insurance.\\n\\n\"We\\'re basically going to try to find work doing whatever we can down here,\" Hernandez said. \"I mean, we made our lives down here.\"\\n\\n4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/2xF7rpJ', u'title': u\"It's not business as usual for Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma\", u'url': u'http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/15/its-not-business-usual-florida-keys-after-hurricane-irma/669352001/', u'uri': u'726389434', u'eventUri': None, u'dateTime': u'2017-09-15T20:26:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-15', u'source': {u'title': u'Florida Today', u'id': u'11259', u'uri': u'floridatoday.com'}, u'time': u'20:26:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 7, u'id': u'15173629', u'sim': 0}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'I\\'ll never forget a group of people -- some of them homeless veterans -- who were staying at the Salvation Army shelter when an EF4 tornado hit Tuscaloosa on April 27, 2011.

War blows apart a lot of things, so you have to make a lot of things, which puts a lot of people to work building a lot of things, which puts a lot of other people to work digging a lot of things from the ground in order to build those things. Hurricanes blow apart a lot of things, too.\\n\\nIf that logic held completely true, however, the best thing we could do whenever we are trying to come out of economic collapse would be to blow up every city in the nation so we could build it all over again. While WWII did end the Great Depression, logic tells us there is a more complex tale to tell.\\n\\nThere is a difference between an increase in economic activity, which improves economic statistics and puts people to work, and wealth accumulation. Wars (and hurricanes) create a flurry of economic activity, which may juice the economy as WWII did, but you eventually have to pay for all of that so it doesn\\'t build wealth for a nation overall because of the debit side of the accounting sheet ... unless, of course, one nation takes spoils of war from the nations it defeats, which then bear the burden of doing worse for decades to follow while the victorious nation is better off; but we didn\\'t do that in WWII. We built up the nations we ravaged. So, how did we wind up better after WWII?\\n\\nWhat gets left out of the wartime economic recovery equation is debt. WWII proved stimulus spending works, but what is not considered it that the US had very little debt before that and enormous debt at the end. What a wartime economy or a hurricane reconstruction economy really do is move spending forward. They force infrastructure spending now, accelerating deficit spending and total debt.\\n\\nWe have just seen how easily that works with President Trump\\'s rapid successful lifting of the US debt ceiling. Prior to Harvey, nearly everyone believed the debt ceiling would be the next major battle in congress. Harvey whisked us immediately past that battle ... for the time being.\\n\\nAnd, of course, all of that spending juices the economy while it is happening; but the story is much more complex.\\n\\nHarvey created a more important concern than the debt ceiling. Few politicians (and, indeed, few American taxpayers) want to be the ones to tell American communities that are clobbered by something horrible they cannot control, \"Sorry, we are not about to help you.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s just not what we do. No matter how much we disagree, Americans have always been good about pitching in to help communities that faced calamity. While we often complain that people should not build in those areas, I have to think we all know it is not practical to say that the entire east coast and gulf coast should remain unpopulated within a hundred miles of the coastline in order to keep from having catastrophic hurricane damage. That would, in fact, be a recipe for chronic economic failure because those coastlines with their many port cities and vibrant tourist economies are, during normal times, a huge economic engine for the national economy.\\n\\nWhat we can do is build things much better to reduce the costs of these disasters when they happen. We have actually applied that lesson in many places so that hurricanes have brought about infrastructure and building improvements. In the aftermath of a hurricane, reconstruction can become a short-term economic boon by putting hundreds of thousands of people to work in reconstruction (both to replace and to improve what was already there) but they can also get us to position ourselves for a better economic future because the quality of the infrastructure is better in those areas and holds up better when the next storm hits, helping keep those economies running better next time disaster hits.\\n\\nThat\\'s what happens when we\\'re smart and disallow cheap construction that will not handle 150-mile-per hour winds. The improvement of building codes is why we already see many beautiful buildings in Florida and homes on stilts that withstood Irma.\\n\\nWhere we are dumb and continue to allow mobile homes in order to be nice to those that cannot afford the better quality housing, we see total devastation because we refused to accept reality, which is that those structures cannot exist in those areas. Nature won\\'t allow it. Reality always wins over what we want or think should be in a fair world.\\n\\nSo, the short of it is that we WILL rebuild after Harvey and Irma because that\\'s what we do. We cannot leave hundred-mile strips of a seventeen hurricane-prone states uninhabited and see any economic gain from that. And rebuilding WILL create economic stimulus.\\n\\nWhat is hard to equate is whether the economic stimulus will outweigh the losses in other areas of business and what the longterm balance is to the hurricane losses and stimulus gains.\\n\\nInitially, there will also be some economic decline. Many places of work will be closed for a few weeks. Unemployment in those areas will rise. Some businesses will be destroyed for good because they were underinsured. Those that served the tourist industry will be clobbered for a long time. Tourists will be scared off short-term because tourists don\\'t want to have their vacation wrecked by the next 2017 hurricane. They will be scared off longterm even after the hurricane season because they know the area will be ugly and filled with reconstruction noise for a long time, and none of that sounds like a vacation plan to anyone.\\n\\nSo, the broader story is that some businesses, such as construction, will see a large boost from these hurricanes while others suffer decline.\\n\\nAfter Harvey, some articles I read stated that the auto industry, which was already starting down a major decline, would be harmed further. I thought that was ridiculous and that just the opposite is likely to be true. Sure, dealers are out of business for a few weeks as clean-up begins and until inventory gets replaced, so they are experiencing short-term losses right now; but most of their inventory was insured and will be replaced, and their parking lots for the most part are not likely to be hugely damaged by the storms. So, in a month or two, their businesses will boom as individuals who lost hundreds of thousands of cars seek to replace them.\\n\\nI am certain we will find that Harvey (and now Irma) actually did the declining auto industry a huge favor. By wiping out a million automobiles, these storms insure that a million more automobiles will be manufactured and sold. This will undoubtedly be a boon to used-car prices, too, as wholesalers are already bidding on used cars all over the nation to move them into Texas.\\n\\nExactly how that shakes out depends, of course, on how well insured businesses and individuals were and how well insurance companies are able to fulfill their obligations. The balancing equation to the auto industry\\'s gains (and there always is a balancing debit) comes in the form of the insurance industry\\'s losses. Banks should be fairly well protected because they require everyone to insure the cars they make loans on; but they, too, may get hit by some people walking away from their auto loans.\\n\\nWhat hurricanes fundamentally do is simply stir things up into chaos, mixing hot air with cold air and land with water. The same is true of what they do economically. Hurricanes shift the economic losses and economic gains. Automakers will certainly be making more autos as a result, so those regions of the country with economies partially based on auto manufacturing should see some reprieve to their recent troubles. (It won\\'t be enough to end their secular downturn; but it should buy them some time.)\\n\\nOn the other side of the equation, some insurance companies may die off due to the double-whammy of Harvey and Irma or, a least, close off parts of their business in some states. Some investors in those companies will lose, and other parts of the country like Hartford, Connecticut, that have economies based on insurance, could see a loss of jobs. If auto dealers had inventory that wasn\\'t insured, they may go bankrupt and walk away from their \"flooring\" loans (the dealer-banker term for loans used to buy inventory). So, banks could take a hit from this if they didn\\'t keep close enough track of inventory insurance.\\n\\nThe same thing will happen to banks with respect to the real estate industry. Building construction will gain, but many who are underinsured will walk away from their mortgages. So, wherever insurance companies don\\'t bear the burden, banks are likely to. Thus, all of this ripples in c0mplex gains and losses throughout the US economy, and only time will tell where it all settles out.\\n\\nWhile Hurricanes Harvey and Irma assure us that spending will be moved forward from the future, there is no free lunch. When we borrow against the future to rebuild now, we heap more burden on ourselves (or our children) down the road, reducing spending capacity later on. It took decades after World War II to pay the war debt back down, and an argument can be made (and has been made) that this caused a long low-grade recession in later years by bearing down on money available for spending in the post-war years.\\n\\nFor all their flurry and the activity they cause, the net longterm effect of hurricanes has usually been economically detrimental. It took a decade to get New Orleans back on its feet, and I\\'m sure many individuals who left and never returned also took a decade to get their lives back on track.\\n\\nWe saw the hit to businesses with Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, which somewhat ironically marks its twenty-fifth anniversary this Monday just as Irma finishes tearing through Florida. (Florida\\'s most infamous Hurricane Andrew also had its twenty-fifth anniversary only a few weeks ago.) Iniki, a category 4 hurricane, was one of the most costly hurricanes in US history at the time. It destroyed 1,500 homes and damaged thousands of others. The tourism business took years to recover, and some tourism businesses in Iniki\\'s most ravaged areas never recovered. Twenty-five years later, one major celebrated resort still lies in ruins.\\n\\nThe great Coco Palms with all its local jobs, fame and economic vitality never existed again.\\n\\n\"The problem is once everything is all said and done, this type of magnitude, of this type of distraction, takes years and years and years and years to recover,\" Chang said. Chang worked as the head concierge at the former Westin resort near the airport.... Although at the time it seemed to last forever, Chang now remembers the storm itself as a brief moment in time. It\\'s the days, months, and years after that tell the true story of Iniki. \"The aftermath is things that people don\\'t even think about, and the aftermath is devastating,\" Chang said. \"It just is not rebuilt the way you wish it would rebuild.\" (KHON TV)\\n\\nDuring the months after Iniki, many insurance companies left Hawaii completely. It was almost a decade before most of these insurance companies returned. Kauai suffered longterm decline because of Iniki, though it has mostly recovered many years later.\\n\\nMore than a decade after the Katrina disaster, New Orleans is now mostly rebuilt. Many parts are better than they were, but the city has experienced some loss of its old culture.\\n\\nWe can rebuild, and we do go on. At our best, we become more resilient. At our best, we also use disaster to make things better than they were. I am sure we will do the same after Harvey and Irma, but the idea that rebuilding is an economic boon is a complex story of gains and losses that created longterm drags on the nation as whole in the years of paying those debts. As economic activity is brought forward due to hurricanes, some will get rich; many others become poorer; and some losses will remain for decades.\\n\\nIniki, as an example, was a plus for the local chicken population, busting apart coops and blowing chickens all over the island. These chickens have continued to thrive as feral chickens in the wild ever since. That diaspora of chickens may, in turn, have been quite hard on the poisonous centipede population (bad for the bugs but good for people) because chickens love poisonous centipedes. In other words, when hurricanes stir things up, some gain while others lose. As in the bird and bug world, so in the human realm.\\n\\nHarvey and Irma will improve some economic statistics, causing a flurry in home construction and auto construction that may offset some of our nation\\'s recent declines in those areas, but those gains are experienced as losses in other parts of the US economy and by many uninsured individuals. The longterm wealth of the nation , regardless of any stimulus benefits, is not made greater because it is offset by longterm debts and losses in other areas.\\n\\nFor example, the debt ceiling got an immediate lift, but the nation\\'s total debt next time we face the debt ceiling will look all the worse, making a debt ceiling agreement tougher to come by. Trump gets his infrastructure stimulus plan after all, and he gets it right away; but most of it will just be spent replacing what was lost, not making us a stronger nation, so it will make next year\\'s debt problems all the more difficult because it does not improve longterm economic growth to cover the new debt; it merely replaces capacity that was just lost.', u'title': u'Hurricanes Harvey and Irma May Lend Helping Hand to Economy, but Hurricane Iniki and Katrina Tell More Complex Longterm Tales | From the Trenches World Report', u'url': u'http://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/hurricanes-harvey-irma-may-lend-helping-hand-economy-hurricane-iniki-katrina-tell-complex-longterm-tales/207902', u'uri': u'724741450', u'eventUri': None, u'dateTime': u'2017-09-13T11:54:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-13', u'source': {u'title': u'From the Trenches World Report', u'id': u'17200', u'uri': u'fromthetrenchesworldreport.com'}, u'time': u'11:54:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 12, u'id': u'14580588', u'sim': 0}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'I\\'ll never forget a group of people -- some of them homeless veterans -- who were staying at the Salvation Army shelter when an EF4 tornado hit Tuscaloosa on April 27, 2011.

A lot of people in the community are moving around to friends that got power back or have generators,\" he told Hamodia. \"There are a lot of downed trees and some leaks, but it\\'s nowhere near the level of devastation we were afraid of.\"\\n\\nAs of Monday afternoon, nearly all of North Miami Beach was without power and most of Miami Beach proper as well, with sporadic exceptions. In a small sign of the continued disruption of life in the city, many to whom Hamodia attempted to reach out were not able to respond amid widespread loss of phone service.\\n\\nA few local mosdos and shuls were offering supper to those who still had no electricity, and a local kosher supermarket offered affected families food packages as well.\\n\\nMost shuls were able to resume regular minyanim. Rabbi Matz said that his shul managed not to miss a minyan even in the thick of Irma\\'s blow. Schools would remain closed at least until Wednesday, with many without power and large amounts of staff out of town.\\n\\nWhile the storm and power outages have proven a hardship to many, there has been particular concern for Miami\\'s elderly.\\n\\nHatzolah had organized a data base prior to the storm of all the members of the community who had chosen to stay. It has proven a useful tool, particularly for relatives of elderly people who live elsewhere and wanted to check up on their loved ones. In many instances, volunteers have been sent to check on the wellbeing of seniors and other high-risk residents. Hatzolah units from New York and New Jersey had prepared to send personnel and equipment to assist amid dire predictions last week, but the effort was scaled back after Miami was spared large-scale damage.\\n\\nAt the same time, the many who had heeded official warnings to evacuate were asked to remain where they were for the time being to allow for clean-up efforts to proceed, and to mitigate the traffic caused by hundreds of thousands returning en masse.\\n\\n\"The city has handled this very professionally and they are asking people not to come back until tomorrow so they can clean up the debris. If everybody rushes back at once, the gridlock will be terrible,\" he said.\\n\\nAn additional complication for many who left to other locations was that by Monday, the storm had moved north, making travel difficult as it struck cities such as Atlanta, where well over 1000 people from various frum communities had taken refuge.\\n\\nRabbi Yitzchok Tendler, executive director of Beth Jacob, Atlanta\\'s largest shul, who was directing the massive hospitality effort, said Irma\\'s arrival, albeit in the downgraded form of a tropical storm, had added a complication to providing for the many guests. Beth Jacob has been offering meals to the many displaced Floridians, but as the area lost power on Monday and driving conditions became treacherous, organizers scrambled to shift plans.\\n\\n\"We\\'re racing against the sunlight here and figuring out how to work this,\" Rabbi Tendler told Hamodia. He said that his team was preparing pans of food that would be picked up or delivered to host families. \"It\\'s very windy and raining, anything not tied down is blowing around, but it\\'s still drivable.\"\\n\\nRabbi Tendler said that the many Floridians in Atlanta were largely relieved that they would most likely be able to return to find their homes and communities physically intact, but were beginning to feel the effects of \"cabin fever.\"\\n\\n\"They realize that the hurricane is trapping them here at this point, they are feeling a little bad to keep imposing on their hosts, but overall it\\'s been a very positive experience,\" he said.\\n\\nDr. Ron Ezoory, an Atlanta dentist who was one of the many Atlantans hosting a Miami family, said that taking part in his community\\'s massive hachnassas orchim effort had been \"a wonderful experience.\"\\n\\n\"We are all enjoying this opportunity to be together with so many different types of Jews from different places; it\\'s been very motivating,\" he told Hamodia as storm winds were rattling his windows and had left his home without power. \"Trees are swaying everywhere. I don\\'t feel that we\\'re in danger, but you can really hear the wind and rain; it\\'s much stronger than the storms we are used to here.\"\\n\\nAn additional source of anxiety for Dr. Ezoory were his elderly parents who live in Hollywood, Florida. He had tried to convince them to come to Atlanta, but said that his parents had opted to \"hunker down\" at home.\\n\\n\"My mother is a Holocaust survivor and the idea of having to run away was too traumatic for her,\" he said. \"My father was a soldier in the Israeli army, so he\\'s used to digging in ... They got provisions and boarded up the windows with aluminum sheets and my mother sat and said Tehillim as the boards shook in the wind.\"\\n\\nIn cities along Florida\\'s eastern coast, even with most having no electricity, residents felt they had \"dodged a bullet.\"\\n\\n\"We have a lot of trees down around my house, but baruch Hashem, only minor damage,\" Yechezkel Rodal, an attorney who lives in Lauderhill, told Hamodia. \"I had to maneuver around streets blocked by downed trees to get to Shacharis this morning and the shul had no power. It was very hot, but the minyan went on.\"\\n\\nRabbi Ruvi New, director of Chabad of Boca Raton, was among the many throughout the state who were arranging a mass meal in his shul for the many in his area without power.\\n\\n\"There were a lot of power outages, but baruch Hashem we were really spared the worst,\" he said.\\n\\nIn Boca Raton and the Ft. Lauderdale area, as in Miami, major coordination efforts allowed for volunteers to keep track of elderly residents.\\n\\n\"The chessed that has gone on around this storm is unbelievable,\" said Mr. Rodal. \"People are doing everything they can to help each other.

Many storm-ravaged areas are troubled by heat and unbearable humidity, workers often wishing or searching for an air conditioned cafe or coffee shop in areas that still have electricity for respite from the heat of the late summer sun.\\n\\nOfficials in Houston and Baytown and as far south down the coast as the Port of Corpus Christi are warning of the dangers from standing water and polluted tributaries near the coast. Environmental officials warn of the possibility that bays and channels are contaminated from sunken vessels or barges -- fuel and the petrochemicals they carry leaching into the waterways. Some have no fresh running water for drinking or bathing.\\n\\nMOSQUITO INVASION\\n\\nNot the least of worries, and a concern that is growing as each day passes, is the rapid population explosion of mosquitoes and the diseases they may be carrying. Jason Ott, Nueces County agricultural agent in Corpus Christi, says mosquitoes go from egg to adult in 4 to 14 days, depending on conditions. The process of development from egg to adult takes less time when the weather is hot.\\n\\n\"Mosquitoes are aquatic in all but the biting adult stage. Eggs, larvae and pupae must have water to mature into blood-feeding adults,\" he said. \"Adult mosquitoes emerge from the aquatic pupal stage and begin to feed. Males feed on nectar [while] females feed on nectar initially, but then they must feed on blood to produce eggs.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), all mosquito species go through four distinct stages during their life cycle, from egg hatch as larvae, mosquitoes progress to pupae and then adult stage. The first three stages occur in water, but the adult is an active flying insect. But only the female mosquito bites and feeds on the blood of humans or other animals. After she obtains a blood meal, the female mosquito lays her eggs directly on or near water, soil and at the base of some plants in places that may fill with water. The eggs can even survive dry conditions for several months.\\n\\nMOST DANGEROUS CREATURE\\n\\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, mosquitos may well be the most dangerous creatures on earth. The Illinois Department of Public Health claims the diseases mosquitoes spread have been responsible for killing more people than all the wars in history. Even in modern times, mosquitoes transmitting malaria kill 2 to 3 million people and infect another 200 million or more globally every year. Tens of millions more are killed and debilitated by a host of other mosquito-borne diseases, including filariasis, yellow fever, dengue, and encephalitis.\\n\\nIn the United States, encephalitis, meningitis and other diseases can develop from the bites of mosquitoes infected with certain viruses. These include the viruses of West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, LaCrosse (California) encephalitis, and Eastern equine and Western equine encephalitis. In more recent years however, a new threat has emerged -- Zika virus.\\n\\nZika is transmitted to humans primarily (but not limited) to two specific mosquito species. These are the same type of mosquitoes that spread dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika virus in humans is usually mild with symptoms lasting up to a week, and many people do not have symptoms at all, or will experience only mild discomfort. However, a Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly along with other severe brain defects.\\n\\nMost mosquito species bite actively at dusk and dawn, however, the two mosquito species that transmit the Zika virus and many other diseases - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus - bite during daytime, and at dusk and dawn.\\n\\nOver all, mosquitoes can be described in two groups, depending on where the eggs are laid. One type is floodwater mosquitoes. They lay their eggs on moist soil in areas prone to flood. The eggs lay dormant on the soil surface until the site floods again, at which point the eggs will hatch. Some eggs are weather resistant and can withstand desiccation for up to two years. Summer flooding often results in large populations of these biting floodwater mosquitoes. Floodwater mosquitoes are typically aggressive and deliver a painful bite. But floodwater mosquitoes are not considered primary in human disease transmission.\\n\\nThe second group of mosquitoes lay eggs in standing water. Some prefer to lay eggs in water-filled tree holes, while others prefer artificial containers. Some of these mosquitoes are major players in the transmission of human disease,\\n\\nPREVENTION IS CRUCIAL\\n\\n\"Prevention of mosquito bites and disease outbreaks will require taking steps to disrupt the mosquito life cycle. Mosquitoes must have food, shelter, and water to live. Remove any one of these - especially standing water - and they cannot survive. Without water, there are no larvae,\" Ott explained.\\n\\n\"The most effective thing people can do to reduce mosquito populations is to eliminate standing water. Gutters, boat tarps, under-treated swimming pools, tires, toys, buckets, bird baths, water features, catch dishes under potted plants, cans, bottles, and other containers are all locations that can hold enough water for mosquitoes to breed. When dealing with mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease, anything that will hold water is a problem, so eliminating these types of items around the house or on the farm will reduce mosquito populations.\"\\n\\nAs far as the best way to avoid mosquito bites, experts say simply avoid them. And the best way to that is a generous application of a mosquito repellent containing Deet. A remarkably effective alternative is a commercial lemon eucalyptus repellent.\\n\\nIn a 2015 study, Deep Woods repellent containing Deet provided a 94 percent reduction in mosquito attraction upon application, and four hours later it was still providing protection equal to 71 percent reduction in attraction. By comparison, Cutter\\'s lemon eucalyptus repellent provided 91 percent reduced attraction at application and 82 percent reduced attraction four hours later.', u'title': u'Hurricanes and floods not the only thing hampering recovery in Texas', u'url': u'http://www.southwestfarmpress.com/insects/hurricanes-and-floods-not-only-thing-hampering-recovery-texas', u'uri': u'721553540', u'eventUri': u'eng-3414783', u'dateTime': u'2017-09-06T18:36:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-06', u'source': {u'title': u'Southwest Farm Press magazine', u'id': u'2940', u'uri': u'southwestfarmpress.com'}, u'time': u'18:36:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 3, u'id': u'13449978', u'sim': 0.7411764860153198}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'It appears mega-storm Irma will hit someplace hard enough to damage Southeast agriculture over the weekend.\\n\\nThe direct track Hurricane Irma will decide is not fully understood right now, but it appears the mega-storm will hit someplace hard enough to damage Southeast agriculture.\\n\\nReports say hotel rooms in south Georgia are already filling up with Florida residents leaving the state ahead of the storm, which is predicted to hit Florida this weekend.\\n\\nAndy Robinson and his brother Scott were digging peanuts ahead of the storm. In a phone interview Wednesday, he said he and the other farmers who farm in Levy County about 20 miles southwest of Gainesville, Fla., were watching closely which way Irma was leaning. Almost all of the peanuts in the peanut-heavy area are ready to be harvested now, and Robinson said he\\'d like to get them all safely out of the field before Irma hits, but that isn\\'t going to happen. Robinson said he has dug about 40 percent of his peanuts, which leaves well over half his crop vulnerable to Irma\\'s potential damage, which will most likely come from flooding.\\n\\nOnce peanuts are dug, they can stand to stay underwater a few days before being harvested. A storm in 2014 put a lot of Robinson\\'s dug peanuts under 14 inches of water for several days, and the peanuts fared OK. It\\'s the ones not yet dug that he worries about. Due to a hot, humid summer, leaf spot has cranked up big in fields. After Irma, that problem might explode.\\n\\nMost of the latest models have Irma leaning toward Florida\\'s east coast. Robinson plans to stay put. But if the storm ends up tracking further west, eyeing Florida\\'s gulf coast, he might take the family and ride the storm out someplace else.\\n\\nMDA Weather Services issued a special alert Sept. 9 pointing out the risk Hurricane Irma poses to Florida\\'s citrus and sugarcane crops.\\n\\n\"The exact track of the storm will be a major determining factor on the extent of the crop damage,\" said Don Keeney, senior agricultural meteorologist for MDA Weather Services. \"A storm track right over the center of the Florida peninsula would likely result in significant damage to citrus trees and sugarcane plants. \"A track just to the east of Florida would lower damage potential for crops within Florida but would in turn increase threats to cotton, corn, and soybean crops in the Carolinas. \"\\n\\nIf Irma comes straight up Florida or scrapes down the eastern seaboard, it would mark three years in a row a devastating tropical weather event has hit at or near harvest time for row crops farmers in the region. Hurricane Matthews hit hard South Carolina and North Carolina farmers along the coast and further inland last October as harvest entered the high gears, which made two years in a row for such a disaster in that region. Growers said then two years in a row was enough to alter farming in the area. Three years in a row would alter thing dramatically.\\n\\nRow crops farmers from Florida up through Georgia to the Carolinas need a good solid harvest this year. Up until now, the stage has been set to have it this year with record to excellent yields predicted in many locations for peanuts, cotton and soybeans.\\n\\nState departments of ag respond\\n\\nThe Georgia Department of Agriculture released a statement Sept. 6 saying it is \"working with all of our state, federal and industry partners to support the safety and comfort of Georgia citizens, their animals and our Florida neighbors fleeing the storm.\"\\n\\nGDA has temporarily suspended Animal Interstate Movement Health Requirements for entry into Georgia for the transportation of animals from areas expected to be impacted by Hurricane Irma in Florida. The suspension of entry requirements applies to animals entering Georgia from Florida only.\\n\\nEffective Sept. 7 at 8 a.m. the Georgia National Fairgrounds & Agricenter in Perry, Ga., will serve as an equine evacuation site for those in the line of Hurricane Irma.

Ninety-five percent of the island is destroyed,\" top local official Daniel Gibbs said in a radio interview. \"I\\'m in shock.

As a result, people have said for decades there is nothing like a wartime economy to bring recovery from economic recession. War blows apart a lot of things, so you have to make a lot of things, which puts a lot of people to work building a lot of things, which puts a lot of other people to work digging a lot of things from the ground in order to build those things. Hurricanes blow apart a lot of things, too.\\n\\nIf that logic held completely true, however, the best thing we could do whenever we are trying to come out of economic collapse would be to blow up every city in the nation so we could build it all over again. While WWII did end the Great Depression, logic tells us there is a more complex tale to tell.\\n\\nThere is a difference between an increase in economic activity, which improves economic statistics and puts people to work, and wealth accumulation. Wars (and hurricanes) create a flurry of economic activity, which may juice the economy as WWII did, but you eventually have to pay for all of that so it doesn\\'t build wealth for a nation overall because of the debit side of the accounting sheet ... unless, of course, one nation takes spoils of war from the nations it defeats, which then bear the burden of doing worse for decades to follow while the victorious nation is better off; but we didn\\'t do that in WWII. We built up the nations we ravaged. So, how did we wind up better after WWII?\\n\\nWhat gets left out of the wartime economic recovery equation is debt. WWII proved stimulus spending works, but what is not considered it that the US had very little debt before that and enormous debt at the end. What a wartime economy or a hurricane reconstruction economy really do is move spending forward. They force infrastructure spending now, accelerating deficit spending and total debt.\\n\\nWe have just seen how easily that works with President Trump\\'s rapid successful lifting of the US debt ceiling. Prior to Harvey, nearly everyone believed the debt ceiling would be the next major battle in congress. Harvey whisked us immediately past that battle ... for the time being.\\n\\nAnd, of course, all of that spending juices the economy while it is happening; but the story is much more complex.\\n\\nHarvey created a more important concern than the debt ceiling. Few politicians (and, indeed, few American taxpayers) want to be the ones to tell American communities that are clobbered by something horrible they cannot control, \"Sorry, we are not about to help you.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s just not what we do. No matter how much we disagree, Americans have always been good about pitching in to help communities that faced calamity. While we often complain that people should not build in those areas, I have to think we all know it is not practical to say that the entire east coast and gulf coast should remain unpopulated within a hundred miles of the coastline in order to keep from having catastrophic hurricane damage. That would, in fact, be a recipe for chronic economic failure because those coastlines with their many port cities and vibrant tourist economies are, during normal times, a huge economic engine for the national economy.\\n\\nWhat we can do is build things much better to reduce the costs of these disasters when they happen. We have actually applied that lesson in many places so that hurricanes have brought about infrastructure and building improvements. In the aftermath of a hurricane, reconstruction can become a short-term economic boon by putting hundreds of thousands of people to work in reconstruction (both to replace and to improve what was already there) but they can also get us to position ourselves for a better economic future because the quality of the infrastructure is better in those areas and holds up better when the next storm hits, helping keep those economies running better next time disaster hits.\\n\\nThat\\'s what happens when we\\'re smart and disallow cheap construction that will not handle 150-mile-per hour winds. The improvement of building codes is why we already see many beautiful buildings in Florida and homes on stilts that withstood Irma.\\n\\nWhere we are dumb and continue to allow mobile homes in order to be nice to those that cannot afford the better quality housing, we see total devastation because we refused to accept reality, which is that those structures cannot exist in those areas. Nature won\\'t allow it. Reality always wins over what we want or think should be in a fair world.\\n\\nSo, the short of it is that we WILL rebuild after Harvey and Irma because that\\'s what we do. We cannot leave hundred-mile strips of a seventeen hurricane-prone states uninhabited and see any economic gain from that. And rebuilding WILL create economic stimulus.\\n\\nWhat is hard to equate is whether the economic stimulus will outweigh the losses in other areas of business and what the longterm balance is to the hurricane losses and stimulus gains.\\n\\nInitially, there will also be some economic decline. Many places of work will be closed for a few weeks. Unemployment in those areas will rise. Some businesses will be destroyed for good because they were underinsured. Those that served the tourist industry will be clobbered for a long time. Tourists will be scared off short-term because tourists don\\'t want to have their vacation wrecked by the next 2017 hurricane. They will be scared off longterm even after the hurricane season because they know the area will be ugly and filled with reconstruction noise for a long time, and none of that sounds like a vacation plan to anyone.\\n\\nSo, the broader story is that some businesses, such as construction, will see a large boost from these hurricanes while others suffer decline.\\n\\nAfter Harvey, some articles I read stated that the auto industry, which was already starting down a major decline, would be harmed further. I thought that was ridiculous and that just the opposite is likely to be true. Sure, dealers are out of business for a few weeks as clean-up begins and until inventory gets replaced, so they are experiencing short-term losses right now; but most of their inventory was insured and will be replaced, and their parking lots for the most part are not likely to be hugely damaged by the storms. So, in a month or two, their businesses will boom as individuals who lost hundreds of thousands of cars seek to replace them.\\n\\nI am certain we will find that Harvey (and now Irma) actually did the declining auto industry a huge favor. By wiping out a million automobiles, these storms insure that a million more automobiles will be manufactured and sold. This will undoubtedly be a boon to used-car prices, too, as wholesalers are already bidding on used cars all over the nation to move them into Texas.\\n\\nExactly how that shakes out depends, of course, on how well insured businesses and individuals were and how well insurance companies are able to fulfill their obligations. The balancing equation to the auto industry\\'s gains (and there always is a balancing debit) comes in the form of the insurance industry\\'s losses. Banks should be fairly well protected because they require everyone to insure the cars they make loans on; but they, too, may get hit by some people walking away from their auto loans.\\n\\nWhat hurricanes fundamentally do is simply stir things up into chaos, mixing hot air with cold air and land with water. The same is true of what they do economically. Hurricanes shift the economic losses and economic gains. Automakers will certainly be making more autos as a result, so those regions of the country with economies partially based on auto manufacturing should see some reprieve to their recent troubles. (It won\\'t be enough to end their secular downturn; but it should buy them some time.)\\n\\nOn the other side of the equation, some insurance companies may die off due to the double-whammy of Harvey and Irma or, a least, close off parts of their business in some states. Some investors in those companies will lose, and other parts of the country like Hartford, Connecticut, that have economies based on insurance, could see a loss of jobs. If auto dealers had inventory that wasn\\'t insured, they may go bankrupt and walk away from their \"flooring\" loans (the dealer-banker term for loans used to buy inventory). So, banks could take a hit from this if they didn\\'t keep close enough track of inventory insurance.\\n\\nThe same thing will happen to banks with respect to the real estate industry. Building construction will gain, but many who are underinsured will walk away from their mortgages. So, wherever insurance companies don\\'t bear the burden, banks are likely to. Thus, all of this ripples in c0mplex gains and losses throughout the US economy, and only time will tell where it all settles out.\\n\\nWhile Hurricanes Harvey and Irma assure us that spending will be moved forward from the future, there is no free lunch. When we borrow against the future to rebuild now, we heap more burden on ourselves (or our children) down the road, reducing spending capacity later on. It took decades after World War II to pay the war debt back down, and an argument can be made (and has been made) that this caused a long low-grade recession in later years by bearing down on money available for spending in the post-war years.\\n\\nFor all their flurry and the activity they cause, the net longterm effect of hurricanes has usually been economically detrimental. It took a decade to get New Orleans back on its feet, and I\\'m sure many individuals who left and never returned also took a decade to get their lives back on track.\\n\\nWe saw the hit to businesses with Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, which somewhat ironically marks its twenty-fifth anniversary this Monday just as Irma finishes tearing through Florida. (Florida\\'s most infamous Hurricane Andrew also had its twenty-fifth anniversary only a few weeks ago.) Iniki, a category 4 hurricane, was one of the most costly hurricanes in US history at the time. It destroyed 1,500 homes and damaged thousands of others. The tourism business took years to recover, and some tourism businesses in Iniki\\'s most ravaged areas never recovered. Twenty-five years later, one major celebrated resort still lies in ruins.\\n\\nThe great Coco Palms with all its local jobs, fame and economic vitality never existed again.\\n\\n\"The problem is once everything is all said and done, this type of magnitude, of this type of distraction, takes years and years and years and years to recover,\" Chang said. Chang worked as the head concierge at the former Westin resort near the airport.... Although at the time it seemed to last forever, Chang now remembers the storm itself as a brief moment in time. It\\'s the days, months, and years after that tell the true story of Iniki. \"The aftermath is things that people don\\'t even think about, and the aftermath is devastating,\" Chang said. \"It just is not rebuilt the way you wish it would rebuild.\" (KHON TV)\\n\\nDuring the months after Iniki, many insurance companies left Hawaii completely. It was almost a decade before most of these insurance companies returned. Kauai suffered longterm decline because of Iniki, though it has mostly recovered many years later.\\n\\nMore than a decade after the Katrina disaster, New Orleans is now mostly rebuilt. Many parts are better than they were, but the city has experienced some loss of its old culture.\\n\\nWe can rebuild, and we do go on. At our best, we become more resilient. At our best, we also use disaster to make things better than they were. I am sure we will do the same after Harvey and Irma, but the idea that rebuilding is an economic boon is a complex story of gains and losses that created longterm drags on the nation as whole in the years of paying those debts. As economic activity is brought forward due to hurricanes, some will get rich; many others become poorer; and some losses will remain for decades.\\n\\nIniki, as an example, was a plus for the local chicken population, busting apart coops and blowing chickens all over the island. These chickens have continued to thrive as feral chickens in the wild ever since. That diaspora of chickens may, in turn, have been quite hard on the poisonous centipede population (bad for the bugs but good for people) because chickens love poisonous centipedes. In other words, when hurricanes stir things up, some gain while others lose. As in the bird and bug world, so in the human realm.\\n\\nHarvey and Irma will improve some economic statistics, causing a flurry in home construction and auto construction that may offset some of our nation\\'s recent declines in those areas, but those gains are experienced as losses in other parts of the US economy and by many uninsured individuals. The longterm wealth of the nation , regardless of any stimulus benefits, is not made greater because it is offset by longterm debts and losses in other areas.\\n\\nFor example, the debt ceiling got an immediate lift, but the nation\\'s total debt next time we face the debt ceiling will look all the worse, making a debt ceiling agreement tougher to come by. Trump gets his infrastructure stimulus plan after all, and he gets it right away; but most of it will just be spent replacing what was lost, not making us a stronger nation, so it will make next year\\'s debt problems all the more difficult because it does not improve longterm economic growth to cover the new debt; it merely replaces capacity that was just lost.', u'title': u\"Hurricane Harvey aids Trump's infrastructure spending program\", u'url': u'http://www.safehaven.com/article/44718/hurricane-harvey-aids-trumps-infrastructure-spending-program', u'uri': u'724927546', u'eventUri': None, u'dateTime': u'2017-09-13T19:43:00Z', u'date': u'2017-09-13', u'source': {u'title': u'safehaven.com', u'id': u'13301', u'uri': u'safehaven.com'}, u'time': u'19:43:00', u'isDuplicate': False, u'wgt': 12, u'id': u'14647222', u'sim': 0}, {u'lang': u'eng', u'body': u'I\\'ll never forget a group of people -- some of them homeless veterans -- who were staying at the Salvation Army shelter when an EF4 tornado hit Tuscaloosa on April 27, 2011. They crawled from the wreckage of the badly damaged shelter and ran down the street to help pull people from other buildings that had been obliterated, digging victims from piles of bricks, cinder-blocks and collapsed roofs.\\n\\nWhenever bad things happen, I tell my kids to look for the people doing good.\\n\\nIt\\'s advice I\\'ve borrowed from Fred Rogers of the television show \"Mister Rogers\\' Neighborhood,\" who once told a story about when he was a boy and would see scary things on the news: \"My mother would say to me, \\'Look for the helpers,\\' \" Rogers said. \" \\'You will always find people who are helping.\\' To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother\\'s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers -- so many caring people in this world.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a story I repeat to my three children often, especially as of late.\\n\\nIt\\'s something that, as a journalist, I have witnessed, people coming together in times of need. It\\'s something that can restore a person\\'s belief in humanity. It can bolster the belief that people are generally good -- the belief that when a disaster happens, it can bring out the best in people.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen religious and racial barriers disappear when a natural disaster occurs, when socioeconomic differences cease to exist. I\\'ve seen neighbors helping neighbors, strangers coming out of nowhere, wanting to help. Perhaps they have a chainsaw to offer, a hot meal or a case of bottled water.\\n\\nIt was something I saw 12 years ago after Hurricane Katrina. I spoke to evacuees who had fled New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast and found refuge in hotels and Red Cross shelters. I interviewed families who lost everything, people who crowded around TVs to glimpse aerial views of their neighborhoods covered with water. Within only a few days, people were delivering meals, taking families shopping for new clothes, even helping people find apartments stocked with donated furniture.\\n\\nThe worst of times brings out the good.\\n\\nI thought of those Katrina evacuees the morning after the tornado tore across Tuscaloosa, across my neighborhood, in 2011. Suddenly, I was the one who was waking up in a hotel, not knowing when I would be able to go home or what the future may bring. It was my turn to deal with insurance companies, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with contractors and cleanup crews. The American Red Cross drove down my street handing out meals, as helicopters roared overhead. Volunteers from across the country showed up to help clear debris. The volunteers were people we had never met, who worked tirelessly through the night, cutting our giant, fallen oaks into pieces, trying to clear the roads.\\n\\nThey were the good during the bad.\\n\\nTo the people of Texas, I know it\\'s hard to be hopeful when you don\\'t know what the future will bring. It\\'s hard to see the light when you\\'ve been thrown down a rabbit hole by Mother Nature, and you wonder if your city, your neighborhood and your street will ever be the same again. It\\'s difficult to know what the next step may be to recover, when the path before you seems muddied and confusing. But you will recover. Your cities will come back. Normalcy will return.\\n\\nIt won\\'t happen in a few days. It may not happen in weeks or even months. But life as you knew it will return. It won\\'t be easy, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just remember to look for the people doing good.\\n\\nAnd for the others reading this, in Alabama and elsewhere, remember how people have helped us. It\\'s our time to give back.\\n\\n-- Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News.
